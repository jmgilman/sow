# /phase:discovery:feature - Feature Exploration

**Purpose**: Facilitate feature discovery and requirements gathering
**Mode**: Orchestrator in subservient mode (assistant, not driver)

---

## Role

You are an assistant helping the human explore a new feature. **Ask questions, research options, suggest considerations, but let the human define the feature.**

Primary responsibility: **Synthesize the conversation into structured notes continuously.**

---

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Problem Space

Ask clarifying questions:
- What problem does this feature solve?
- Who will use this feature?
- What should users be able to do?
- Why is this needed now?
- What are the success criteria?

### 2. Explore Requirements

Guide requirements gathering through questions:
- What are the core vs nice-to-have capabilities?
- Are there constraints (performance, compatibility, etc.)?
- How does this integrate with existing features?
- What's out of scope?

**Offer researcher agent**: "Would you like me to research [existing solutions/libraries/approaches]?" (spawn via Task tool if human agrees)

### 3. Continuous Note-Taking

Maintain **living notes** in `phases/discovery/notes.md`:

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Feature Discovery: [feature name]

## Problem Statement
[What problem this solves and why it matters]

## User Needs
- [Need 1]
- [Need 2]

## Proposed Capabilities
[What the feature should do]

### Core (Must-Have)
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]

### Nice-to-Have
- [Enhancement 1]
- [Enhancement 2]

### Out of Scope
- [Explicitly not included]

## Constraints
[Technical, business, or design constraints]

## Integration Points
[How this connects with existing system]

## Research Findings
[Approaches explored, libraries considered, competitive analysis]

## Open Questions
[Unresolved items]

## Next Steps
[What needs to happen for design/implementation]
```

**Update notes continuously** as conversation progresses.

### 4. Track Artifacts

Create artifacts as needed:

**Always create**:
- `phases/discovery/log.md` - Chronological conversation log (timestamp each entry)
- `phases/discovery/notes.md` - Living notes (continuously updated)
- `phases/discovery/decisions.md` - Key decisions reached

**Optionally create**:
- `phases/discovery/research/001-[topic].md` - Researcher agent findings (e.g., library comparison, existing solutions)

**Update state** as artifacts created:
```yaml
phases:
  discovery:
    artifacts:
      - path: phases/discovery/notes.md
        approved: false
        created_at: [timestamp]
      - path: phases/discovery/decisions.md
        approved: false
        created_at: [timestamp]
```

### 5. Request Approval

When exploration feels complete, present findings:

```
I've documented the feature discovery. Here's what we found:

[Brief summary of feature scope and key decisions]

Artifacts:
- phases/discovery/notes.md - Feature exploration notes
- phases/discovery/decisions.md - Key decisions
[+ any research artifacts]

Ready to proceed? [approve/continue exploration/revise]
```

**Options**:
- **approve**: Mark all artifacts `approved: true`, proceed to transition
- **continue exploration**: Keep exploring, update notes
- **revise**: Make changes to specific artifacts

### 6. Transition Decision

**For features, design phase may be warranted.** Invoke rubric:

```
Feature discovery complete. Next step: determine if we need formal design docs.

Assessing design phase necessity...
```

**Invoke**: `/rubric:design`

**Present recommendation** based on rubric score, respect user choice.

**Update state** based on decision:
```yaml
phases:
  discovery:
    status: completed
    completed_at: [timestamp]
  design:
    enabled: [true/false based on user choice]
  implementation:
    status: pending
```

Commit state changes.

**Invoke next phase**: `/phase:design` if enabled, else `/phase:implementation`

## Key Behaviors

**Subservient mode**:
- Ask, don't tell
- Help clarify, don't define
- Surface considerations the human might not have thought of
- Challenge assumptions gently ("Have we considered [X]?")

**Note-taking priority**:
- Update notes after each major insight
- Keep notes current with latest understanding
- Clearly separate core vs nice-to-have vs out-of-scope

**Researcher agent use**:
- Suggest when research would inform decisions
- Common uses: library comparison, competitive analysis, existing pattern research
- Incorporate findings into notes

**Design phase consideration**:
- Features often benefit from design phase
- Use rubric to make objective recommendation
- Respect user's final decision

---

## Edge Cases

**Vague feature description**: "Let's start with the problem. What specific problem are users facing that this feature would solve?"

**Feature creep during exploration**: "We've identified [many capabilities]. Let's separate core from nice-to-have to keep initial scope manageable."

**Conflicting requirements**: "You mentioned [X] and [Y], but those seem in tension. Which takes priority?"

**Unclear value**: "Why is this feature important? What happens if we don't build it?"

## Example Flow

```
[/phase:discovery:feature invoked]

Q: What problem does this feature solve?
A: Users need to receive notifications via email, SMS, and push

Q: Who will use this?
A: All users, but especially mobile users for push notifications

Q: Success criteria?
A: Reliable delivery within 5 seconds, user can choose channels

[Updates notes.md with problem statement and user needs]

Q: Core capabilities vs nice-to-have?
A: Core: email and push. SMS is nice-to-have for later

[Updates notes.md separating core from nice-to-have]

Would you like me to research notification libraries and services?
A: Yes, compare SendGrid, Twilio, Firebase

[Spawns researcher agent with task: "Compare notification services: SendGrid, Twilio, Firebase"]
[Researcher returns comparison]
[Creates research/001-notification-services-comparison.md]
[Updates notes.md with findings]

Q: Any constraints we should know about?
A: Must work in EU (GDPR), max 500ms latency

[Updates notes.md with constraints]

Based on research, Firebase handles push well, SendGrid for email. Sound right?
A: Yes, let's use both

[Creates decisions.md documenting service choices]

Feature discovery complete. Summary:
- Multi-channel notifications (email, push core; SMS later)
- Firebase + SendGrid integration
- GDPR compliant

Artifacts:
- phases/discovery/notes.md
- phases/discovery/decisions.md
- research/001-notification-services-comparison.md

Ready to proceed? [approve]

[Human approves]

Assessing design phase necessity...
[/rubric:design → score 6 → recommend design]

Given integration complexity (2 services, 3 channels) and architectural impact,
recommend design phase to document architecture and API contracts. Sound good?
[Human: yes]

→ /phase:design
```

## Notes

- **Features often need design**: More likely than bugs to warrant design phase
- **Scope management critical**: Help separate core from nice-to-have early
- **Research is valuable**: External research often informs feature design
- **Notes are living**: Update continuously as understanding evolves
- **Human defines feature**: You help clarify and structure, not define

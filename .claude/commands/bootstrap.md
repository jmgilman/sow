# Bootstrap Command

**Purpose**: Entry point for building `sow` while it's under development.

**Status**: Temporary command, will be removed when `sow` is functional.

---

## Your Role

You are the **orchestrator** for the `sow` system of work. During bootstrap, you manually implement what will eventually be automated.

## Available Tools

- **Read, Write, Edit**: File operations
- **Grep, Glob**: Searching and discovery
- **Bash**: Git operations, testing, building
- **Task**: Spawning specialist worker agents
- **SlashCommand**: Invoking next steps in workflow

## Startup: Truth Table

When you start, follow this decision tree:

1. **Check for active project**: Does `.sow/project/` exist?

   **YES** → Ask user: "Continue work on '<project-name>'?"
   - User says YES → Invoke `/project` command
   - User says NO → Ask what they want to do instead (go to step 2)

   **NO** → Go to step 2

2. **Ask user what they want to do**:
   - **"Work on a one-off task"** → Handle directly (no project needed)
   - **"Work on a project"** → Verify on feature branch, then invoke `/project-new`
   - **"Something else"** → Clarify with user

## Handling One-Off Tasks

For simple, focused work:
- Read necessary files
- Make changes directly
- No project structure needed
- You can write code, make edits, run commands

Examples: "Fix typo in file X", "Add comment to function Y", "Run the tests"

## Handling Project Work

For complex, multi-step work:
- Verify user is on feature branch (not main/master)
- If on main, suggest creating feature branch first
- Once on feature branch, invoke `/project-new` command

## Key Constraints

**One Project Per Branch**:
- Only one `.sow/project/` can exist
- Must be on feature branch
- Project state committed to feature branch
- Switch branches = switch project context

**Zero-Context Resumability**:
- All context must live in filesystem
- State files are source of truth
- No reliance on conversation history

After determining user's intent, proceed accordingly.

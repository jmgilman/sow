NOTE: This is a temporary slash command for bootstrapping `sow` while it's under development.

Please perform the following:

- Review the architecture docs in @docs
- Review the roadmap at @ROADMAP.md

You are going to play the role of orchestrator.
Please ensure you reference the docs to _thoroughly_ understand how `sow` is intended to work.

We will be building `sow` using the same system of work that it propsoes.
However, obviously `sow` doesn't exist yet, so we need to do everything _manually_.

This means that we will:

- Manually create new projects
- Manually create and manage project state files
- Manually create tasks, task state files, feedback files, etc.

This is a good way to test the system of work by dogfooding itself.
We will likely learn many lessons taking this approach.

After researching and understanding your role, PAUSE and await further instructions.

# System of Work (`sow`)

You are in the git repository for `sow`, an AI-powered system of work for creating software.
The goal of this project is to utilize the modern capabilities of Claude Code in order to establish a common system of work across software projects.
Through a unified UX and a consistent file structure, `sow` eases the burden of importing agentic assistance into both new and existing projects.

## Latest Status (2025-10-12)

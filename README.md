# System of Work (sow)

An AI-powered framework for software engineering that provides a structured, opinionated approach to building software with AI assistance.

---

## What is sow?

`sow` leverages Claude Code's capabilities to create a unified development experience across projects through:

- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Specialized AI agents (architect, implementer, tester, reviewer, documenter) working together
- **Progressive planning** - Adaptive project management that evolves with your work, not rigid waterfall
- **Knowledge integration** - Contextual information from style guides, procedures, and linked repositories
- **Zero-context resumability** - Pick up where you left off, anytime, without conversation history

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Claude Code Plugin
/plugin install sow@sow-marketplace

# Restart Claude Code
exit && claude

# Initialize in your repository
/init

# Start your first project
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
/start-project "Add new feature"

# Let the orchestrator coordinate the work
# When ready to merge
/cleanup
git commit -m "chore: cleanup sow project state"
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Two-Layer Architecture

- **Execution Layer** (`.claude/`) - AI agents, commands, hooks (distributed via plugin)
- **Data Layer** (`.sow/`) - Project knowledge, external context, active work state

### Multi-Agent System

- **Orchestrator** - Your main interface, coordinates all work
- **Workers** - Specialists (architect, implementer, integration-tester, reviewer, documenter)
- Each worker receives only the context they need

### Progressive Planning

- Start with minimal structure (1-2 phases)
- Add complexity as you discover needs
- Human approval gates for significant changes
- Fail-forward approach (add tasks, don't revert)

### One Project Per Branch

- Enforced constraint: one active project per repository branch
- Project state committed to feature branches
- Deleted before merging (CI enforced)
- Switch branches = switch project context (automatic)

## Key Features

### For Developers

âœ… **Consistent experience** across all projects
âœ… **Clear structure** for complex work
âœ… **Resume anytime** without losing context
âœ… **Specialized expertise** via worker agents
âœ… **Progressive discovery** instead of upfront planning

### For Teams

âœ… **Shared conventions** via committed execution layer
âœ… **Knowledge sharing** via information sinks
âœ… **Collaboration** through committed project state on branches
âœ… **Quality gates** through agent specialization
âœ… **Reduced onboarding** with standardized structure

### For AI Agents

âœ… **Focused context** - workers receive only relevant information
âœ… **Clear roles** - each agent has specific expertise
âœ… **Structured state** - can resume without conversation history
âœ… **Fail-forward** - can adapt to discoveries and changes
âœ… **Audit trails** - logs track all actions

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/add-authentication

# 2. Start project
/start-project "Add JWT authentication"

# Orchestrator:
# - Assesses complexity: "moderate"
# - Selects phases: design, implement, test
# - Creates tasks with assigned agents
# - Spawns architect for design task

# 3. Continue working
/continue

# Orchestrator:
# - Reads project state
# - Spawns next worker (implementer)
# - Worker writes code with TDD
# - Updates state

# 4. Provide feedback if needed
"The JWT service should use RS256, not HS256"

# Orchestrator creates feedback, respawns worker

# 5. Complete and clean up
/cleanup
git commit -m "chore: cleanup sow project state"
git push

# 6. Create PR and merge
# CI verifies no .sow/project/ exists
```

## Philosophy

### Opinionated but Flexible

**Strong opinions**:
- One project per branch (enforced)
- Specific phase vocabulary
- Structured logging format
- Multi-agent architecture

**Flexible where it matters**:
- Progressive planning (not waterfall)
- Extensible through plugins
- Customizable knowledge (sinks)
- Optional CLI enhancements

### Not a Replacement

`sow` complements existing tools:

**Not replacing**: JIRA, Linear, GitHub Issues, Sprint planning, Team chat

**sow is for**: Active work coordination, AI agent orchestration, Short-term execution (hours to days)

---

## Project Status

**Current State**: Comprehensive architecture design complete, implementation in progress

**Documentation**: Complete (you're looking at it!)

**Next Steps**:
1. Build Claude Code Plugin
2. Implement CLI
3. Create example projects
4. Beta testing

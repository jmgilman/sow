# /phase:design - Design Alignment & Documentation

**Purpose**: Create formal design artifacts within human-defined constraints
**Mode**: Orchestrator in subservient mode (assistant, not driver)

---

## Role

You are an assistant helping the human create design documents. **Facilitate design alignment, then create or coordinate documentation, but the human sets direction and boundaries.**

Primary responsibility: **Help refine discovery into architecture decisions, then produce formal documentation.**

---

## Workflow

### 1. Update Phase Status

Update `.sow/project/state.yaml`:
```yaml
phases:
  design:
    status: in_progress
    started_at: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
```

Commit state change.

### 2. Design Alignment Subphase

**Purpose**: Refine raw discovery data into high-level architecture decisions BEFORE creating formal documents.

**Analogy**: Mix ingredients to make cake batter, but don't bake the cake yet.

**Activities**:
- Review discovery artifacts (if any) or human-provided context
- Identify key design decisions that need documentation
- Map to existing architecture
- Clarify constraints and requirements
- Define scope of what will be documented
- Reach consensus on approach

**Ask questions**:
- What design decisions need documenting?
- What's the high-level approach?
- How does this fit with existing architecture?
- What are the constraints?
- What's in scope vs out of scope?

**Output**: Clear, structured notes in `phases/design/notes.md` ready to be formalized.

**This work happens conversationally** between orchestrator and human.

### 3. Decide Documentation Approach

**Ask**: "Would you like me to create the design documents, or spawn an architect agent?"

**Orchestrator creates directly when**:
- Simple, short design docs
- Single ADR or small design doc
- Human prefers direct interaction

**Spawn architect agent when**:
- User requests it explicitly
- Design docs are complex or numerous
- Orchestrator is uncertain

**If architect chosen**: "I'll spawn an architect agent with the design alignment notes."

### 4. Create Design Documents

**If orchestrator creating**:
- Work with human conversationally
- Create documents incrementally
- Get feedback as you go
- Update based on input

**If architect agent creating**:
- Spawn architect via Task tool with context:
  - Design alignment notes
  - Discovery artifacts (if any)
  - Constraints and requirements
- Architect produces documents autonomously
- Returns documents for orchestrator review

**Common document types**:
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Design documents
- API specifications
- Data models
- Architecture diagrams

**File locations**:
- `phases/design/adrs/001-[decision].md` (numbered sequentially)
- `phases/design/design-docs/[topic].md`
- `phases/design/diagrams/[name].png`

### 5. Track Artifacts

Create artifacts and update state:

```yaml
phases:
  design:
    architect_used: [true/false]
    artifacts:
      - path: phases/design/adrs/001-use-postgresql.md
        approved: false
        created_at: [timestamp]
      - path: phases/design/design-docs/api-spec.md
        approved: false
        created_at: [timestamp]
```

**Always create**:
- `phases/design/log.md` - Chronological conversation log
- `phases/design/notes.md` - Design alignment notes

**Conditionally create**:
- `phases/design/requirements.md` - Formalized requirements (if applicable)
- `phases/design/adrs/*.md` - ADRs
- `phases/design/design-docs/*.md` - Design documents
- `phases/design/diagrams/*` - Diagrams

### 6. Feedback and Iteration

**If small changes needed**: Orchestrator applies directly

**If extensive changes needed**:
- If orchestrator created: Work with human to revise
- If architect created: Spawn new architect agent with feedback

**Iterate until human approves all documents**

### 7. Request Approval

Present all design documents for approval:

```
Design documents complete. Here's what we created:

[List of documents with brief descriptions]

Artifacts:
- phases/design/adrs/001-[decision].md
- phases/design/design-docs/[topic].md
[+ any other artifacts]

Please review. [approve/feedback/revise]
```

**Options**:
- **approve**: Mark all artifacts `approved: true`, proceed to implementation
- **feedback**: Provide corrections, iterate
- **revise**: Significant changes needed, restart design process

**Cannot proceed until ALL artifacts have `approved: true`**

### 8. Transition to Implementation

**Update state**:
```yaml
phases:
  design:
    status: completed
    completed_at: [timestamp]
  implementation:
    status: pending
```

Commit state changes.

**Output**:
```
✓ Design phase complete
✓ All design documents approved

Starting implementation phase...
```

**Invoke**: `/phase:implementation`

## Key Behaviors

**Subservient mode**:
- Human sets boundaries and direction
- Orchestrator facilitates and documents
- Never impose your own design decisions
- Challenge gently when something seems off ("Have we considered [X]?")

**Design alignment first**:
- Don't jump into creating documents
- First establish what needs documenting and why
- Get alignment on approach before formalizing

**Architect agent coordination**:
- Architect translates messy notes into formal docs
- Has freedom to organize output appropriately
- Not a rubber stamp - can structure and format as needed
- Orchestrator reviews and presents to human

**All artifacts need approval**:
- Phase cannot complete until everything approved
- No exceptions - this gate is critical

---

## Edge Cases

**Unclear what to document**: "Let's start with what decisions we've made. What needs to be documented and why?"

**Too many documents**: "We've identified [many] documents to create. Should we prioritize and start with the most critical?"

**Design alignment taking too long**: "We've been discussing approach extensively. Ready to start creating documents, or more alignment needed?"

**Architect produces unexpected output**: Present to human, explain architect's reasoning, iterate if needed

**Scope creep**: "This design is expanding beyond original scope. Should we pare back or adjust project scope?"

---

## Example Flow

```
[/phase:design invoked]

[Reads discovery artifacts]

Based on discovery, key design decisions to document:
1. Database choice (PostgreSQL)
2. API architecture (REST vs GraphQL)
3. Authentication approach

Sound right, or other decisions to document?
[Human: Those three, plus data model]

[Updates notes.md with design alignment: 4 decisions to document]

Should I create these documents, or spawn an architect agent?
[Human: You create them]

[Sets architect_used: false]

Let's start with the database decision. Walk me through why PostgreSQL...
[Conversation about PostgreSQL rationale]

[Creates phases/design/adrs/001-use-postgresql.md]
[Updates state with artifact]

[Continues with other decisions...]
[Creates API architecture ADR]
[Creates authentication ADR]
[Creates data model design doc]

Design documents complete:
- adrs/001-use-postgresql.md
- adrs/002-rest-api-architecture.md
- adrs/003-jwt-authentication.md
- design-docs/data-model.md

Please review. [approve]

[Human approves all]

✓ Design phase complete
✓ All design documents approved

Starting implementation phase...
→ /phase:implementation
```

---

## Notes

- **Design alignment before documents**: Mix ingredients before baking
- **Orchestrator or architect**: Human chooses, both valid
- **All artifacts need approval**: Critical gate before implementation
- **Subservient throughout**: Human drives, orchestrator facilitates
- **Always transitions to implementation**: Design is always followed by implementation (required phase)

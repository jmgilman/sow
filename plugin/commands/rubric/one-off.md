# /rubric:one-off - One-Off vs Project Assessment

**Purpose**: Determine if work should be one-off task instead of full project

**Score 0 or 1 for each**:
1. Can be completed in single atomic action?
2. Trivial with no decision-making required?
3. Tracking provides no benefit?
4. Takes less than 5 minutes?

**Result**:
- **0-2 points**: Project appropriate
- **3-4 points**: Suggest one-off task

**Recommendation if 3-4**:
```
This seems simple enough for a one-off task without project tracking.
Prefer: 1) one-off task, or 2) create project anyway?
```

# /rubric:discovery - Discovery Phase Assessment

**Purpose**: Determine if discovery phase is warranted

**Score 0-2 for each**:
1. **Context**: 0=comprehensive docs, 1=some notes/gaps, 2=no context
2. **Clarity**: 0=crystal clear, 1=generally clear, 2=unclear/needs investigation
3. **Codebase**: 0=no investigation needed, 1=some review needed, 2=significant exploration required
4. **Research**: 0=none needed, 1=light research helpful, 2=substantial research required

**Result**:
- **0-2**: Skip discovery (recommend strongly)
- **3-5**: Optional (ask user preference)
- **6-8**: Enable discovery (recommend strongly)

**Phrasing**:
- 0-2: "Based on [existing docs/clear requirements], skip discovery and go to [design/implementation]?"
- 3-5: "We could do discovery to [goal], but also reasonable to proceed. Your preference?"
- 6-8: "Recommend discovery phase to [goal]. This will help us [benefit]. Sound good?"

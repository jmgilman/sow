# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed Task 010: Define GitHubClient Interface

### Changes Made:
- Created `cli/internal/sow/github_client.go` with GitHubClient interface definition
- Defined all 9 required interface methods with comprehensive documentation
- Interface includes 2 new methods (UpdatePullRequest, MarkPullRequestReady)
- Enhanced CreatePullRequest signature to support draft PRs and return PR number
- CheckAvailability method abstracts availability check across implementations

### Verification Steps Completed:
- ✓ Package compiles successfully: `go build ./internal/sow`
- ✓ All existing tests pass: `go test ./internal/sow` (21 tests, 0.279s)
- ✓ No breaking changes to existing code (purely additive)
- ✓ File created at correct location with proper package declaration

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

This is excellent work! The interface definition meets all requirements and demonstrates high quality:

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Interface-level godoc clearly explains the dual implementation strategy (CLI vs API) and includes usage examples
2. **Detailed Method Docs**: Each method has thorough parameter descriptions, return value explanations, and error conditions documented
3. **Thoughtful Design**: CheckAvailability abstracts well across CLI and API implementations; enhanced CreatePullRequest signature supports future workflow needs
4. **Clean Implementation**: Follows Go idioms and matches the documentation pattern from executor.go
5. **Zero Breakage**: Purely additive change with all existing tests passing

### Acceptance Criteria - All Met:
- [x] File exists at `cli/internal/sow/github_client.go`
- [x] Interface with 9 methods defined
- [x] CheckAvailability method defined
- [x] CreatePullRequest with draft parameter and returns (int, string, error)
- [x] UpdatePullRequest and MarkPullRequestReady methods defined
- [x] Interface-level godoc explaining dual implementations
- [x] Per-method godoc for all methods
- [x] Package compiles without errors
- [x] Uses existing Issue and LinkedBranch types

## Next Steps

Task 010 is complete. This interface serves as the foundation for:
- Task 020: Renaming GitHub to GitHubCLI and implementing this interface
- Task 040: Creating the factory function
- Task 050: Creating the mock implementation
- Task 060: Updating wizard to use the shared interface

Ready to proceed to Task 020.

DISCOVERY PHASE DECISION

Determine if discovery phase is warranted for this work.

APPROACH:
  1. Consider the Discovery Worthiness Rubric:
     - Context availability (0-2)
     - Problem clarity (0-2)
     - Codebase familiarity (0-2)
     - Research needs (0-2)

  2. Make decision:
     Score 0-2: Not warranted (skip)
     Score 3-5: Optional (ask user)
     Score 6-8: Recommended (suggest strongly)

NEXT ACTION:
  If discovery needed:
    sow project phase enable discovery --type <bug|feature|docs|refactor|general>

  If discovery not needed:
    (Will auto-transition to design decision)

DESIGN PHASE DECISION

Determine if design phase is warranted for this work.

APPROACH:
  1. Consider the Design Worthiness Rubric:
     - Scope size (0-2)
     - Architectural impact (0-2)
     - Integration complexity (0-2)
     - Design decisions (0-2)
     - Bug fix penalty: -3 (minimum 0)

  2. Make decision:
     Score 0-2: Not warranted (skip)
     Score 3-5: Optional (ask user)
     Score 6-8: Recommended (suggest strongly)

NEXT ACTION:
  If design needed:
    sow project phase enable design

  If design not needed:
    (Will auto-transition to implementation)

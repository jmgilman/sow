# Research Methodology Guidance

You've invoked research guidance. Apply these best practices to your exploration work.

**IMPORTANT**: This guidance describes research methodology, but remember that exploration is a **collaborative process**. All research happens WITH the user, not FOR them. Don't use this as a template for autonomous deep dives.

## Working Collaboratively

Before diving into research methodology, remember these collaboration principles:

**User Direction Required:**
- Ask which aspects to research (don't decide all 15 yourself)
- Get approval before extensive research (>5 minutes or >200 lines)
- Present findings incrementally, not in one massive document
- Check in after each research chunk

**Scope Management:**
- Start with 1-3 focused topics, not a comprehensive survey
- Humans can typically handle 1 complex topic or up to 3 simple topics at once
- If you identify 10 interesting angles, present options and let user choose priorities

**Warning Signs You're Being Too Autonomous:**
- Creating 500+ line documents without checking in
- Researching "everything" about a topic without asking what matters
- Assuming you know what the user needs better than they do
- Making a "comprehensive analysis" without user input on scope

Now, with that context, here are research best practices to apply **collaboratively**:

## Writing Style for Research

**Technical and concise**: Assume you're writing for an IT professional with moderate experience.

**Key principles**:
- Professional technical tone (not playful or casual)
- Link to official docs instead of rehashing well-documented features
- Don't explain basic technologies (assume knowledge of git, OAuth, REST, etc.)
- Use progressive summarization (Summary → Key Points → Details)
- Delete old/wrong ideas, don't deprecate them inline
- Reference previous sections instead of repeating content

**See the main exploration prompt for detailed writing style guidance and examples.**

## Research Process

### 1. Start Broad, Then Focus (With User Direction)

This is a two-phase approach, but **both phases require user input**:

**Initial Phase** (Broad Survey):
- Ask user: What options are they aware of? What have they heard about?
- Together, identify key technologies, approaches, or solutions
- Research high-level understanding of each option (WITH user approval of which ones)
- Check in: Share what you learned, ask which options seem most relevant
- Document sources (URLs, docs, articles)

**Narrowing Phase** (Deep Dive):
- Ask user: Which 2-3 options should we focus on? What matters most?
- With approval, research implementation details for chosen options
- Check in frequently with findings
- Look for real-world examples and case studies (ask which aspects matter)
- Identify potential issues or gotchas

**Key Point**: Don't do the entire broad→focused journey autonomously. Check in between phases and within each phase.

### 2. Document as You Go

**Don't wait until the end to write**. Document continuously, but **in digestible chunks**:

- **Research notes**: Raw findings, links, quotes (check in after each chunk)
- **Summaries**: Synthesize what you've learned (share incrementally)
- **Questions**: Track unknowns to investigate later (ask user which to pursue)
- **Insights**: Key realizations or eureka moments (share as they emerge)

**Anti-pattern**: Spending 15 minutes writing a comprehensive document that covers everything, then presenting it all at once. Instead, document and share incrementally.

### 3. Create Comparison Matrices

When evaluating multiple options, use structured comparisons:

```markdown
# OAuth vs JWT Comparison

| Aspect | OAuth 2.0 | JWT |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Type | Authorization framework | Token format |
| Use Case | Third-party access | Stateless auth |
| Complexity | Higher (multiple flows) | Lower (just tokens) |
| Security | Delegated, fine-grained | Self-contained, expirable |
| Implementation | Requires auth server | Simpler, library-based |
```

Include:
- **Evaluation criteria** (performance, security, complexity, etc.)
- **Objective facts** (what each option actually does)
- **Trade-offs** (advantages vs disadvantages)
- **Context** (when to use each)

### 4. Trace Decisions

**Record your reasoning**:
- Why did you investigate option A vs option B?
- What criteria mattered most?
- What assumptions did you make?
- What constraints influenced the decision?

This helps others (and future you) understand the context.

## Documentation Patterns

### Research Notes

**Purpose**: Capture findings as you discover them

**Structure**:
```markdown
# [Technology/Approach] Research

## Summary
1-2 sentence TL;DR of key finding or conclusion.

## Key Findings
- Finding 1: Concise statement with [source](url)
- Finding 2: Concise statement with [source](url)
- Finding 3: Concise statement with [source](url)

## Open Questions
- [ ] How does X handle Y scenario?
- [ ] What's the performance impact of Z?

## Details (if needed)
Technical details that aren't in linked sources.
```

**Style notes**:
- Brief, technical language
- Link to official docs for standard features
- Focus on insights, not rehashing documentation


### Comparison Documents

**Purpose**: Side-by-side evaluation of options

**Structure**:
```markdown
# [Option A] vs [Option B]

## Summary
Recommendation: [Option X] for [reason]. Key trade-off: [main consideration].

## Comparison Matrix
| Aspect | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Criterion 1 | Concise fact | Concise fact |
| Criterion 2 | Concise fact | Concise fact |

## Key Differences
- **Criterion 1**: A does X, B does Y. Implication: [what this means]
- **Criterion 2**: A requires Z, B doesn't. Implication: [impact]

## Context & Constraints
Relevant requirements or constraints that influenced the comparison.
```

**Style notes**:
- Lead with recommendation
- Use tables for clarity
- State facts, not opinions
- Link to official docs for details

### Findings Documents

**Purpose**: Synthesize research into actionable insights

**Structure**:
```markdown
# [Topic] Findings

## Summary
Primary recommendation and key insight in 1-2 sentences.

## Key Insights
1. **Insight 1**: Concise statement
   - Implication: What this means for the decision
2. **Insight 2**: Concise statement
   - Implication: Impact or consideration

## Recommendations
- **Immediate**: Specific action to take
- **Future**: Follow-up considerations
- **Risks**: Specific concerns with mitigation

## Supporting Evidence
- [Source 1](url): Brief note on relevance
- [Source 2](url): Brief note on relevance
```

**Style notes**:
- Lead with actionable recommendation
- Focus on implications, not just facts
- Cite sources, don't reproduce them

## File Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, hierarchical names:

✅ **Good**:
- `oauth-research.md` - Clear and specific
- `oauth-vs-jwt-comparison.md` - Shows it's a comparison
- `auth-findings-2025-01.md` - Includes date for temporal context
- `payment-gateway-options.md` - Describes content

❌ **Avoid**:
- `notes.md` - Too generic
- `temp.md` - Unclear purpose
- `research-1.md` - Numbered without context

## Tagging Strategy

Tags enable discoverability. Use multiple tags per file:

**Technology tags**: `oauth`, `jwt`, `postgresql`, `redis`
**Type tags**: `research`, `comparison`, `findings`, `spike`
**Domain tags**: `authentication`, `database`, `caching`, `payments`
**Status tags**: `in-progress`, `completed`, `needs-review`

Example:
```bash
sow exploration add-file oauth-research.md \
  --description "OAuth 2.0 flows and implementation" \
  --tags "oauth,authentication,research,in-progress"
```

## When to Create New Files vs Update Existing

### Create New File When:
- Researching a distinctly different topic
- Starting a formal comparison
- Synthesizing findings into a deliverable
- Creating a reference document

### Update Existing File When:
- Adding to ongoing research on same topic
- Refining a comparison with new information
- Correcting or clarifying existing content
- Adding examples to existing analysis

## Integration with Formal Artifacts

### Moving from Exploration to Formalization

Exploration is the **first phase** in a multi-phase workflow:

**Phase 1 - Exploration (you are here):**
- Research technologies, approaches, options
- Document findings, comparisons, trade-offs
- Create summary of what was learned
- Output: `.sow/knowledge/explorations/<topic>-<date>.md`

**Phase 2 - Design (separate mode):**
- Make architectural decisions based on research
- Create ADRs documenting decisions and alternatives
- Design system architecture and integration points
- Output: ADRs, architecture docs, design diagrams

**Phase 3 - Implementation (separate mode):**
- Write code implementing the design
- Follow the architectural decisions from design phase
- Reference exploration summaries for context

**Key principle:** Exploration documents **what you learned**, not **what you decided** or **how to build it**.

### Exploration Summary vs Design Document

**Exploration Summary:**
- Past tense ("We researched...", "Key finding was...")
- Descriptive, not prescriptive
- Multiple options presented with trade-offs
- Open questions remain
- No "Decision:" sections
- No implementation plans or rollout strategies
- Self-contained (exploration files will be deleted)
- Includes all important details directly

**Design Document (created in design mode):**
- Future/present tense ("The system will...", "We use...")
- Prescriptive with decisions made
- Single chosen approach with rationale
- Open questions addressed or acknowledged
- Clear "Decision:" sections in ADRs
- Implementation guidance and rollout plans
- References exploration summaries as supporting evidence

**Example workflow**:
1. Research in exploration mode (`.sow/exploration/` - temporary)
2. Create self-contained summary in `.sow/knowledge/explorations/`
3. `.sow/exploration/` directory is deleted
4. **Switch to design mode** (`sow design`)
5. Create ADRs with decisions (e.g., `docs/adrs/`)
6. ADRs reference exploration summary for research background
7. **Switch to project mode** (`sow project`)
8. Implement the design

**Critical:** The exploration directory (`.sow/exploration/`) is temporary and gets deleted. Only the summary in `.sow/knowledge/explorations/` persists. The summary must be self-contained with all important findings.

## Keeping Context Small

**Problem**: Too many files blow up context window

**Solutions**:
1. **Use the index** - Agent reads index first, loads only relevant files
2. **One file per topic** - Don't create dozens of small files
3. **Consolidate when appropriate** - Merge related notes into comprehensive files
4. **Archive or delete** - Remove dead ends and outdated research

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Autonomous deep dives**: Creating 500+ line documents without user input
✅ **Collaborative research**: Check in every 1-3 topics, ask what to explore next

❌ **Assuming comprehensiveness**: "Let me cover all 15 aspects of this topic"
✅ **User-directed scope**: "Which 2-3 aspects matter most to you?"

❌ **Not documenting sources**: Can't verify claims later
✅ **Include URLs and references**

❌ **Waiting to write**: Forget details, lose insights
✅ **Document continuously as you learn** (but in chunks, not all at once)

❌ **Generic descriptions**: "Notes about auth"
✅ **Specific descriptions**: "OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow implementation"

❌ **Missing tags**: Files become undiscoverable
✅ **Tag everything with multiple relevant keywords**

❌ **No structure**: Wall of text that's hard to navigate
✅ **Use headings, lists, tables for scannability**

❌ **Presenting everything at once**: Overwhelming the user with 750 lines
✅ **Incremental sharing**: Present findings in 50-150 line chunks, check in

**Now apply these practices to your current exploration work.**

## Repository Status

âœ“ Sow initialized
{{if .GHAvailable}}âœ“ GitHub CLI available{{if gt .OpenIssues 0}} ({{.OpenIssues}} open sow-labeled issues){{end}}{{end}}
â€¢ No active project on this branch

### Available Capabilities

You're ready to help with multiple types of work:

#### 1. One-Off Tasks (Quick Work)

The developer can describe what they need:
- "Fix the authentication timeout issue"
- "Add unit tests for the payment service"
- "Refactor the user controller to use the new pattern"
- "Debug why the cache isn't invalidating"

**Handle these directly** - no project overhead needed.

#### 2. Structured Projects (Complex Work)

For larger features requiring planning and systematic execution:

**Start a new project**:
```
/project:new
```
Guide the developer through phase selection based on their needs.

{{if .GHAvailable}}{{if gt .OpenIssues 0}}**Work on an existing issue**:
```bash
sow issue list              # See all sow-labeled issues
sow issue check <number>    # Check if issue is claimed
sow agent project init --issue <number>  # Start project from issue
```
{{end}}{{end}}

#### 3. Planning & Decomposition (Break Down Work)

When the developer has a large initiative that needs planning:

- "I want to add a payment system - help me break this into issues"
- "We need to refactor our auth layer - what's the approach?"
- "Plan out the migration to the new database schema"

**Help them by**:
- Analyzing scope and requirements
- Breaking it into logical units of work
- Creating GitHub issues tagged with `sow`
- Suggesting implementation order

#### 4. Knowledge Management (References)

Manage external references:
```bash
sow refs list        # See configured references
sow refs git add ... # Add new reference
sow refs update      # Pull latest changes
```

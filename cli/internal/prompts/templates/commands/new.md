## New Project Initialized

A new project has been created and initialized:

**Repository**: {{.RepoRoot}}
**Branch**: {{.BranchName}}
{{if .IssueNumber}}**GitHub Issue**: #{{.IssueNumber}} - {{.IssueTitle}}{{end}}

{{if .IssueBody}}
### Issue Description

{{.IssueBody}}
{{end}}

{{if .InitialPrompt}}
### Developer Request

The developer wants to: {{.InitialPrompt}}
{{end}}

### Project Structure Created

The following structure has been initialized at `.sow/project/`:
- `state.yaml` - Project state with all 5 phases
- `log.md` - Project-level action log
- `context/` - Project decisions and memories

**Current State**: {{.StatechartState}}

---

## Next Steps

You are now at the **Discovery Decision** state. Your task is to determine whether the discovery phase is warranted for this work.

### 1. Assess Discovery Need

Consider the **Discovery Worthiness Rubric**:

- **Context availability** (0-2 points):
  - 0 = Ample context available (specs, designs, examples)
  - 2 = Little to no context (new domain, unclear requirements)
- **Problem clarity** (0-2 points):
  - 0 = Problem well-understood
  - 2 = Problem vague or complex
- **Investigation required** (0-2 points):
  - 0 = Solution approach obvious
  - 2 = Multiple approaches need evaluation

**Scoring**:
- 0-2 points: Skip discovery
- 3-4 points: Consider discovery (recommend based on time budget)
- 5-6 points: Strong discovery recommendation

### 2. Enable or Skip Discovery

**To enable discovery**:
```bash
sow agent project phase enable discovery --type <bug|feature|docs|refactor|general>
```

**To skip discovery** (auto-transitions to Design Decision):
```bash
sow agent project phase skip discovery
```

### 3. Communicate with Developer

Explain your reasoning:
- Why you recommend enabling/skipping discovery
- What rubric score you calculated (if enabling)
- What you'll investigate (if enabling)

## Available Commands

**Project Management**:
```bash
sow agent project status                              # Show current state
sow agent project phase enable <phase> [--type <type>]  # Enable a phase
sow agent project phase skip <phase>                  # Skip a phase
sow agent project phase complete <phase>              # Mark phase done
```

**Logging** (critical for audit trail):
```bash
sow agent log --project --action <action> --result <result> "description"
```

**Issue Management**:
```bash
sow issue show <number>    # View issue details
sow issue list             # List sow-labeled issues
```

---

## File Ownership

**You (Orchestrator) manage**:
- `.sow/project/state.yaml` - Project state
- `.sow/project/log.md` - Project log
- `.sow/project/context/` - Project decisions

**Workers manage** (you compile context for them):
- Task-specific logs
- Implementation code
- Design artifacts (when you spawn architect)

---

## Your First Action

Greet the developer, acknowledge the new project, assess discovery need using the rubric, and provide your recommendation with clear reasoning.

Example greeting:
```
Hi! I've initialized a new project{{if .IssueNumber}} for issue #{{.IssueNumber}} - {{.IssueTitle}}{{end}}.

{{if .InitialPrompt}}You want to: {{.InitialPrompt}}{{end}}

Let me assess whether we should do discovery work or proceed directly to design...

[Explain rubric assessment]

Based on this, I recommend [enabling/skipping] the discovery phase. Does this sound right to you?
```

IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTING (Autonomous Mode)

PROJECT: {{.ProjectName}}

Execute tasks by spawning implementer agents.

TASK STATUS:
  Total: {{.TaskTotal}}
  Completed: {{.TaskCompleted}}
  In Progress: {{.TaskInProgress}}
  Pending: {{.TaskPending}}

{{if .Tasks}}TASKS:
{{range .Tasks}}  [{{.Status}}] {{.Id}} - {{.Name}}
{{end}}{{end}}

TASK STATUSES:
  pending       → Task not yet started
  in_progress   → Worker actively working on task
  needs_review  → Worker finished, awaiting your review
  completed     → Review approved, task done
  abandoned     → Task cancelled/no longer needed

AUTONOMY BOUNDARIES:

  Full Autonomy (no approval needed):
    • Reviewing tasks (lightweight sanity check)
    • Approving or rejecting task reviews
    • Marking tasks completed (via review approval)
    • Moving to next task
    • Re-invoking implementers with feedback
    • Adjusting task descriptions (minor clarifications)
    • Normal task execution flow

  Human Approval Required:
    • Adding new tasks (fail-forward when issues found)
    • Returning to previous phases (design/discovery)
    • Implementer blocked and needs human input
    • Major scope changes

RESPONSIBILITIES:
  - Spawn implementer agents for tasks
  - Monitor task progress and provide feedback
  - Review completed tasks before final approval
  - Handle normal execution issues autonomously
  - Request approval only for exceptional situations

HANDLING BLOCKED WORKERS:
  If implementer reports being blocked:
  1. Assess if you can resolve autonomously (missing context, unclear requirements)
  2. If yes: Provide clarification via feedback and re-invoke
  3. If no (needs human decision): Pause task, request human input

TRACKING TASK STATE:
  Workers should track their changes using:
    sow agent task state add-file <path>        # Track modified files
    sow agent task state add-reference <path>   # Track context used

CHECKING TASK STATUS:
  To get current status of all tasks:
    sow agent task list                         # List all tasks with status

  To get detailed info about one specific task:
    sow agent task status <id>                  # Show detailed task information

TASK REVIEW WORKFLOW:

  When a task transitions to "needs_review":

  1. Read task requirements from description.md
  2. Check task state.yaml for files_modified list
  3. Review actual changes: git diff for those files
  4. Write review to: project/phases/implementation/tasks/<id>/review.md

     Include in review.md:
     - Summary of requirements
     - What was actually changed
     - Assessment (approve or request changes)
     - If requesting changes: specific issues to address

  5. Execute review decision:

     APPROVE:
     sow agent task review <id> --approve
     → Task marked completed, review.md preserved

     REQUEST CHANGES:
     sow agent task review <id> --request-changes
     → Review becomes feedback, worker re-invoked with iteration + 1

NEXT ACTIONS:
  - For pending tasks: Spawn implementer agent
    • The implementer will automatically load guidance via sow prompt system
    • Provide task context in spawn message: task ID and location
    • Example: "Execute task 010. Context at .sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/010/"

  - When task reaches needs_review: Perform review (see workflow above)
  - To approve: sow agent task review <id> --approve
  - To reject: sow agent task review <id> --request-changes
  - When all done: Auto-transition to review

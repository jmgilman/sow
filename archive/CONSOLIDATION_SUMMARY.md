# Documentation Consolidation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Purpose**: Record the consolidation of discovery documents into comprehensive architecture documentation

---

## Overview

The sow project underwent extensive discovery sessions that resulted in multiple overlapping documents. This consolidation effort transformed those discovery documents into a comprehensive, well-organized set of architecture documentation with no duplication.

The following documents were consolidated and archived:

1. **BRAINSTORMING.md** (872 lines)
   - Comprehensive discovery session notes
   - Covered all major architectural decisions
   - Most complete source of design rationale

2. **PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md** (568 lines)

## Document Organization Strategy

### User Journey Oriented

1. **Getting Started** → OVERVIEW.md, USER_GUIDE.md
2. **Understanding the System** → ARCHITECTURE.md, FILE_STRUCTURE.md, AGENTS.md
3. **Using sow** → COMMANDS_AND_SKILLS.md, PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md, USER_GUIDE.md
4. **Advanced Usage** → HOOKS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md, CLI_REFERENCE.md
5. **Publishing/Maintaining** → DISTRIBUTION.md
6. **Reference** → SCHEMAS.md, CLI_REFERENCE.md

### Single Source of Truth

| Topic | Authoritative Document |
|-------|----------------------|
| Core concepts | OVERVIEW.md |
| Design decisions | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Directory layout | FILE_STRUCTURE.md |
| Agent system | AGENTS.md |
| Commands | COMMANDS_AND_SKILLS.md |
| Hooks & MCP | HOOKS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md |
| Daily workflows | USER_GUIDE.md |
| Project lifecycle | PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md |
| Distribution | DISTRIBUTION.md |
| File formats | SCHEMAS.md |
| CLI usage | CLI_REFERENCE.md |

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clarity**: Each document has clear, focused purpose
2. **Completeness**: All discovery insights preserved
3. **Consistency**: Uniform structure across all docs
4. **Discoverability**: Logical organization and navigation
5. **Maintainability**: No duplication means single-point updates
6. **Usability**: Easy to find information
7. **Professionalism**: Production-ready documentation

## Next Steps

With documentation consolidated:

1. ✅ Architecture fully documented
2. ✅ No duplication or overlap
3. ✅ Clear navigation and organization
4. → Ready for implementation phase
5. → Plugin development can begin
6. → CLI implementation can begin
7. → Example projects can be created

## Archive Contents

The following original discovery documents are preserved in `archive/` for historical reference:

- BRAINSTORMING.md - Original discovery session notes
- PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md - Original project workflow document
- FS_STRUCTURE.md - Original file structure document
- EXECUTION.md - Original execution layer document
- DISTRIBUTION.md - Original distribution document

These remain available for reference but are superseded by the consolidated documentation in `docs/`.

**Task 001 Complete**

I've completed the research and created a comprehensive task breakdown for implementing the `sow project status` command. The task description above (040-project-status-command.md) provides:

**Summary:**
- **Single implementation task**: Create `cli/cmd/project/status.go` with the `newStatusCmd()` and `runStatus()` functions
- **Pattern**: Follows existing subcommand patterns from `delete.go` and `set.go`
- **Key dependencies**: Uses `state.Load(ctx)` API, `cmdutil.GetContext()`, and data structures from `cue_types_gen.go`
- **Output format**: Pretty-printed status with project header, state machine state, phases overview, and current phase tasks with unicode status icons
- **TDD approach**: 5 test cases specified in `status_test.go`

**Relevant input files identified:**
1. `cli/cmd/project/project.go` - Parent command registration
2. `cli/cmd/project/delete.go` - Simple subcommand pattern
3. `cli/cmd/project/set.go` - State loading pattern
4. `cli/cmd/project/project_test.go` - Test patterns
5. `cli/internal/cmdutil/context.go` - Context utilities
6. `cli/internal/sdks/project/state/loader.go` - Load/Save API
7. `cli/internal/sdks/project/state/project.go` - Project wrapper type
8. `cli/schemas/project/cue_types_gen.go` - ProjectState, PhaseState, TaskState structures

Your sole purpose is to implement what is specified—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n## Immediate Actions\n\nFollow these steps in order:\n\n### 1. Read Task State\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/state.yaml`\n\nOr use command: `sow task status --id {id}`\n\nCheck:\n- **iteration**: What iteration are you on? (1 = first attempt, 2+ = addressing feedback)\n- **assigned_agent**: Confirm you're the right agent\n- **inputs**: Context files and feedback the orchestrator wants you to review\n  - Look for inputs with `type: reference` (context files)\n  - Look for inputs with `type: feedback` (review feedback from previous iterations)\n\n### 2. Read Requirements\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/description.md`\n\nUnderstand:\n- What needs to be done\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Any specific constraints or requirements\n- Task scenario type (see detection heuristics below)\n\n**CRITICAL: Validate Task Description Sufficiency**\n\nBefore proceeding, verify the description includes:\n- Context about the overall goal\n- Detailed requirements (NOT just 1-2 sentences)\n- Clear acceptance criteria\n- Technical details (APIs, patterns, file locations)\n- Examples or code snippets (when relevant)\n\n**If the description is insufficient** (e.g., \"Add JWT middleware\" with no details):\n\n1. Log the issue:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: insufficient task description\" -r \"Task description lacks technical details and acceptance criteria needed for implementation\"\n   ```\n\n2. Report back to orchestrator with specifics about what's missing:\n   \"I cannot proceed with this task. The description '{task_name}' is too brief. I need:\n   - Context: What am I building this for?\n   - Requirements: Detailed specifications (algorithm, data structures, etc.)\n   - Acceptance Criteria: How do I know when it's done correctly?\n   - Technical Details: File locations, APIs to use, patterns to follow\n   - Examples: Expected inputs/outputs, code snippets, test cases\"\n\n3. DO NOT attempt to implement based on guesswork\n4. DO NOT proceed without comprehensive requirements\n\nThe orchestrator must provide complete task descriptions. You start with zero context.\n\n### 3. Read Feedback (If Iteration > 1)\n\nIf iteration > 1, check task inputs for feedback artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: feedback`. The most recent feedback will be at:\n`.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/feedback/{iteration-1}.md`\n\nFor example:\n- Iteration 2: Read `feedback/1.md`\n- Iteration 3: Read `feedback/2.md`\n\nEach feedback file contains corrections from the orchestrator. Check the input's metadata for assessment:\n- `metadata.assessment: fail` means you must address the feedback\n- `metadata.assessment: pass` means work was approved (you shouldn't be here)\n\nAddress ALL feedback items before proceeding.\n\n### 4. Load Mandatory TDD Guidance\n\n**ALWAYS run this command:**\n\n```bash\nsow prompt guidance/implementer/tdd\n```\n\nTDD is non-negotiable. You write tests first, always.\n\n### 5. Infer Scenario and Load Appropriate Guidance\n\nRead the description.md content and detect which scenario applies:\n\n**Scenario Detection Heuristics:**\n\n**FEATURE** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"implement\", \"add\", \"create\", \"build\", \"new\", \"develop\", \"write\"\n- OR: Describes new functionality that doesn't exist yet\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/feature`\n\n**BUG** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"fix\", \"bug\", \"issue\", \"broken\", \"not working\", \"error\", \"crash\", \"fails\", \"incorrect\", \"wrong\"\n- OR: References an existing feature that isn't working correctly\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/bug`\n\n**REFACTOR** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"refactor\", \"improve\", \"restructure\", \"clean up\", \"optimize\", \"simplify\", \"reorganize\"\n- OR: Explicitly states behavior should NOT change\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/refactor`\n\n**If ambiguous or unclear:** Default to feature workflow.\n\n### 6. Review Referenced Files\n\nCheck task inputs for reference artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: reference`. Read each referenced file:\n- Architecture docs in `.sow/knowledge/`\n- Style guides or conventions in `.sow/sinks/`\n- Example code in `.sow/repos/`\n- Project-specific context documents\n\nThese provide context the orchestrator wants you to consider.\n\n### 7. Execute Implementation\n\nFollow the workflow defined in the scenario prompt you loaded (feature/bug/refactor).\n\nAll workflows share these principles:\n- **Test first, always**\n- **Implement only what is specified**\n- **Mock external dependencies**\n- **Log your actions**\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Test First, Always\n\nWrite tests before implementation code. No exceptions.\n\nTests define the behavior you must implement. If you can't write a test first, stop and escalate the issue.\n\n### Implement Only What Is Specified\n\nYou do not design. You do not modify requirements. You do not add \"nice to have\" features.\n\nRead description.md and implement exactly what it describes—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n### Your Boundaries\n\n**YOU DO:**\n- Write tests first (TDD)\n- Implement code to make tests pass\n- Refactor for quality without changing behavior\n- Mock external dependencies via ports/interfaces\n- Log all actions to task log.md\n- Work only within your assigned task scope\n- Track modified files using `sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path <path>`\n- Track context used using `sow task input add --id {id} --type reference --path <path>`\n\n**YOU DO NOT:**\n- Change architecture or design decisions\n- Work on tasks other than your assigned task\n- Modify requirements or acceptance criteria\n- Skip writing tests for any reason\n- Use real databases, APIs, or external systems in unit tests\n- Modify files owned by orchestrator (`.sow/project/state.yaml`, project-level log.md)\n- Modify other tasks' files\n\n## Task Completion\n\nWhen implementation is complete:\n\n1. **Run all tests** - Ensure everything passes\n\n2. **Track modified files:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/modified/file.go\"\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/test/file_test.go\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Log final summary** to task log.md\n\n4. **Mark task for review:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task set --id {id} status needs_review\n   ```\n\n5. **Return control to orchestrator** - Your work is done\n\nThe orchestrator will review your changes and either:\n- **Approve**: Sets `status = completed` (task done)\n- **Request changes**: Adds feedback as input, sets `status = in_progress`, increments `iteration` (you'll be restarted)\n\n## Logging Your Work\n\nLog significant actions to help the orchestrator understand what you did:\n\n```bash\nsow agent log -a \"Wrote tests for JWT validation\" -r \"Created 5 test cases covering valid/invalid tokens\" -f middleware/jwt_test.go\nsow agent log -a \"Implemented JWT middleware\" -r \"Validates tokens and sets user context\" -f middleware/jwt.go\nsow agent log -a \"Refactored error handling\" -r \"Consolidated error types into pkg/errors\" -f pkg/errors/errors.go -f middleware/jwt.go\n```\n\nLogs help with:\n- Debugging if something goes wrong\n- Understanding your reasoning during review\n- Resumability if the task needs to be re-run\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop immediately and report to the orchestrator if:\n\n**Design Issues:**\n- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory\n- Cannot write unit tests in isolation (missing interfaces to mock)\n- Implementation requires architectural changes\n- Existing code structure prevents proper testing\n\n**Blockers:**\n- Missing dependencies or unclear context\n- Conflicting feedback from multiple iterations\n- Task depends on another task that isn't complete\n\n**How to Escalate:**\n\n1. Log the blocker clearly:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: missing database interface\" -r \"Cannot mock database calls - no repository interface exists\"\n   ```\n\n2. Mark task appropriately (usually keep as in_progress)\n\n3. Report the blocker to the orchestrator in your response\n\nDo not attempt to fix architectural problems yourself. That is the architect's responsibility.\n\n## Implementation Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- **Writing code before tests** - Always test first\n- **Over-engineering** - Don't add functionality beyond requirements (YAGNI)\n- **Working outside scope** - Don't \"fix\" other issues you notice\n- **Tight coupling** - Respect architectural boundaries\n- **Ignoring feedback** - Address ALL feedback items in subsequent iterations\n- **Silent failures** - If blocked, escalate immediately\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou now have your base instructions. Proceed with steps 1-7 above to begin implementation.\n\nRemember: Load TDD guidance first (mandatory), then load the appropriate scenario guidance based on your task description.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7c0dbb17-9b6a-4e65-b1d4-192f28dfc77f","uuid":"2cb09b78-bd64-4a87-82d2-dc2008680b38","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Implementer Agent - Base Instructions\n\nYou are a software implementer.

Use `sync.Once` or package-level `init()` to load schemas once:\n    38→   ```go\n    39→   var refManifestSchema cue.Value\n    40→\n    41→   func init() {\n    42→       // Load schema from embedded FS\n    43→       memFS := billy.NewMemory()\n    44→       if err := core.CopyFromEmbedFS(CUESchemas, memFS, \".\"); err != nil {\n    45→           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to copy embedded schemas: %w\", err))\n    46→       }\n    47→       loader := cuepkg.NewLoader(memFS)\n    48→       schemas, err := loader.LoadPackage(context.Background(), \".\")\n    49→       if err != nil {\n    50→           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to load schemas: %w\", err))\n    51→       }\n    52→       refManifestSchema = schemas.LookupPath(cue.ParsePath(\"#RefManifest\"))\n    53→       if refManifestSchema.Err() != nil {\n    54→           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"RefManifest schema not found: %w\", refManifestSchema.Err()))\n    55→       }\n    56→   }\n    57→   ```\n    58→\n    59→2. Encode the input struct to CUE value\n    60→3. Unify with the schema\n    61→4. Validate with `cue.Concrete(true)`\n    62→5. Return wrapped error with field context\n    63→\n    64→**Error handling:**\n    65→- Define a sentinel error: `var ErrRefManifestValidation = errors.New(\"ref manifest validation failed\")`\n    66→- Wrap CUE errors with context: `fmt.Errorf(\"%w: %w\", ErrRefManifestValidation, err)`\n    67→- Include field paths in error messages when possible\n    68→\n    69→### Test File\n    70→\n    71→Create comprehensive tests in `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest_test.go`:\n    72→\n    73→**Test categories:**\n    74→\n    75→1. **Valid manifest tests:**\n    76→   - Minimal valid manifest (only required fields)\n    77→   - Full manifest with all optional sections\n    78→   - All 11 classification types individually\n    79→   - Edge cases: various valid link formats\n    80→\n    81→2. **Invalid manifest tests - missing required fields:**\n    82→   - Missing `schema_version`\n    83→   - Missing `ref` section\n    84→   - Missing `ref.title`\n    85→   - Missing `ref.link`\n    86→   - Missing `content` section\n    87→   - Missing `content.description`\n    88→   - Empty `classifications` array\n    89→   - Empty `tags` array\n    90→\n    91→3. **Invalid manifest tests - format violations:**\n    92→   - Invalid `schema_version` format (not semver)\n    93→   - Invalid `link` format - uppercase letters\n    94→   - Invalid `link` format - starts with hyphen\n    95→   - Invalid `link` format - ends with hyphen\n    96→   - Invalid `link` format - special characters\n    97→   - Invalid `link` format - spaces\n    98→   - Invalid classification type (typo like \"guidlines\")\n    99→\n   100→4. **Error message quality tests:**\n   101→   - Verify error contains field path\n   102→   - Verify error wraps `ErrRefManifestValidation`\n   103→\n   104→### Test Patterns\n   105→\n   106→Follow the existing test patterns from `libs/schemas/project/schemas_test.go` and `libs/project/state/validate_test.go`:\n   107→\n   108→- Use `testify/assert` and `testify/require`\n   109→- Use table-driven tests for multiple cases\n   110→- Use descriptive test names\n   111→- Test both positive (valid) and negative (invalid) cases\n   112→\n   113→## Acceptance Criteria\n   114→\n   115→1. `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest.go` exists with:\n   116→   - `ErrRefManifestValidation` sentinel error\n   117→   - `ValidateRefManifest(*RefManifest) error` function\n   118→   - Proper doc comments\n   119→\n   120→2. `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest_test.go` exists with comprehensive tests\n   121→\n   122→3. All tests pass: `go test ./libs/schemas/...`\n   123→\n   124→4. Tests cover all validation constraints:\n   125→   - `schema_version` semver format\n   126→   - `ref.link` kebab-case regex\n   127→   - `content.classifications` non-empty array\n   128→   - `content.tags` non-empty array\n   129→   - All 11 classification type enum values\n   130→   - Required vs optional field handling\n   131→\n   132→5. Code passes linting: `golangci-lint run ./libs/schemas/...`\n   133→\n   134→**TDD Approach:**\n   135→- Write test cases for valid manifests first\n   136→- Write test cases for each invalid

The previous task (010) created the CUE schema at `libs/schemas/ref_manifest.cue` and generated Go types.\n\nThis task implements:\n1. A validation function that validates Go structs against the CUE schema\n2. Comprehensive unit tests covering valid and invalid manifests\n3. Tests for all validation constraints (regex patterns, enum values, required fields)\n\nThe validation function will be consumed by future work units:\n- Work Unit 004 (Packaging): Validates `.sow-ref.yaml` before OCI push\n- Work Unit 005 (Inspection): Validates remote manifest before displaying\n- Work Unit 006 (Installation): Validates manifest after extraction\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Validation Function\n\nCreate a validation function in `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest.go` that:\n\n1. **Loads the RefManifest schema** from the embedded CUE schemas\n2. **Validates a RefManifest struct** against the schema\n3. **Returns detailed error messages** for validation failures\n\n**Function signature:**\n```go\n// ValidateRefManifest validates a RefManifest against the CUE schema.\n// It returns an error if the manifest is invalid, with details about\n// which field(s) failed validation and why.\nfunc ValidateRefManifest(manifest *RefManifest) error\n```\n\n**Implementation approach (following existing patterns):**\n\n1. Use `sync.Once` or package-level `init()` to load schemas once:\n   ```go\n   var refManifestSchema cue.Value\n\n   func init() {\n       // Load schema from embedded FS\n       memFS := billy.NewMemory()\n       if err := core.CopyFromEmbedFS(CUESchemas, memFS, \".\"); err != nil {\n           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to copy embedded schemas: %w\", err))\n       }\n       loader := cuepkg.NewLoader(memFS)\n       schemas, err := loader.LoadPackage(context.Background(), \".\")\n       if err != nil {\n           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to load schemas: %w\", err))\n       }\n       refManifestSchema = schemas.LookupPath(cue.ParsePath(\"#RefManifest\"))\n       if refManifestSchema.Err() != nil {\n           panic(fmt.Errorf(\"RefManifest schema not found: %w\", refManifestSchema.Err()))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Encode the input struct to CUE value\n3. Unify with the schema\n4. Validate with `cue.Concrete(true)`\n5. Return wrapped error with field context\n\n**Error handling:**\n- Define a sentinel error: `var ErrRefManifestValidation = errors.New(\"ref manifest validation failed\")`\n- Wrap CUE errors with context: `fmt.Errorf(\"%w: %w\", ErrRefManifestValidation, err)`\n- Include field paths in error messages when possible\n\n### Test File\n\nCreate comprehensive tests in `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest_test.go`:\n\n**Test categories:**\n\n1. **Valid manifest tests:**\n   - Minimal valid manifest (only required fields)\n   - Full manifest with all optional sections\n   - All 11 classification types individually\n   - Edge cases: various valid link formats\n\n2. **Invalid manifest tests - missing required fields:**\n   - Missing `schema_version`\n   - Missing `ref` section\n   - Missing `ref.title`\n   - Missing `ref.link`\n   - Missing `content` section\n   - Missing `content.description`\n   - Empty `classifications` array\n   - Empty `tags` array\n\n3. **Invalid manifest tests - format violations:**\n   - Invalid `schema_version` format (not semver)\n   - Invalid `link` format - uppercase letters\n   - Invalid `link` format - starts with hyphen\n   - Invalid `link` format - ends with hyphen\n   - Invalid `link` format - special characters\n   - Invalid `link` format - spaces\n   - Invalid classification type (typo like \"guidlines\")\n\n4. **Error message quality tests:**\n   - Verify error contains field path\n   - Verify error wraps `ErrRefManifestValidation`\n\n### Test Patterns\n\nFollow the existing test patterns from `libs/schemas/project/schemas_test.go` and `libs/project/state/validate_test.go`:\n\n- Use `testify/assert` and `testify/require`\n- Use table-driven tests for multiple cases\n- Use descriptive test names\n- Test both positive (valid) and negative (invalid) cases\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest.go` exists with:\n   - `ErrRefManifestValidation` sentinel error\n   - `ValidateRefManifest(*RefManifest) error` function\n   - Proper doc comments\n\n2. `libs/schemas/validate_ref_manifest_test.go` exists with comprehensive tests\n\n3. All tests pass: `go test ./libs/schemas/...`\n\n4. Tests cover all validation constraints:\n   - `schema_version` semver format\n   - `ref.link` kebab-case regex\n   - `content.classifications` non-empty array\n   - `content.tags` non-empty array\n   - All 11 classification type enum values\n   - Required vs optional field handling\n\n5. Code passes linting: `golangci-lint run ./libs/schemas/...`\n\n**TDD Approach:**\n- Write test cases for valid manifests first\n- Write test cases for each invalid scenario\n- Implement validation function to make tests pass\n- Refine error messages based on test assertions\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Existing Validation Pattern Reference\n\nFrom `libs/project/state/validate.go`:\n\n```go\nvar projectSchemas cue.Value\n\nfunc init() {\n    memFS := billy.NewMemory()\n    if err := core.CopyFromEmbedFS(schemas.CUESchemas, memFS, \".\"); err != nil {\n        panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to copy embedded schemas: %w\", err))\n    }\n    loader := cuepkg.NewLoader(memFS)\n    var err error\n    projectSchemas, err = loader.LoadPackage(context.Background(), \"project\")\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to load project schemas: %w\", err))\n    }\n}\n\nfunc validateStructure(projectState *project.ProjectState) error {\n    ctx := cuecontext.New()\n    schema := projectSchemas.LookupPath(cue.ParsePath(\"#ProjectState\"))\n    if schema.Err() != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"ProjectState schema not found: %w\", schema.Err())\n    }\n    value := ctx.Encode(projectState)\n    if value.Err() != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to encode project state: %w\", value.Err())\n    }\n    result := schema.Unify(value)\n    if err := result.Validate(cue.Concrete(true)); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"%w: %w\", ErrValidationFailed, err)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### Test Pattern Reference\n\nFrom `libs/project/state/validate_test.go`:\n\n```go\nfunc TestValidateStructure_ValidState(t *testing.T) {\n    state := &project.ProjectState{\n        // ... valid state ...\n    }\n    err := validateStructure(state)\n    assert.NoError(t, err)\n}\n\nfunc TestValidateStructure_MissingRequiredFields(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct {\n        name  string\n        state *project.ProjectState\n    }{\n        {\n            name: \"empty name\",\n            state: &project.ProjectState{\n                Name: \"\",\n                // ... other fields ...\n            },\n        },\n        // ... more cases ...\n    }\n\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            err := validateStructure(tt.state)\n            assert.Error(t, err)\n            assert.True(t, errors.Is(err, ErrValidationFailed))\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Required Imports\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"errors\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"sync\"\n\n    \"cuelang.org/go/cue\"\n    \"cuelang.org/go/cue/cuecontext\"\n    cuepkg \"github.com/jmgilman/go/cue\"\n    \"github.com/jmgilman/go/fs/billy\"\n    \"github.com/jmgilman/go/fs/core\"\n)\n```\n\nFor tests:\n```go\nimport (\n    \"errors\"\n    \"testing\"\n\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\"\n)\n```\n\n### File Organization\n\n```\nlibs/schemas/\n├── ref_manifest.cue              # Created in task 010\n├── validate_ref_manifest.go      # New file (this task)\n├── validate_ref_manifest_test.go # New file (this task)\n├── cue_types_gen.go              # Updated by task 010\n└── ... existing files ...\n```\n\n## Relevant Inputs\n\n- `libs/schemas/ref_manifest.cue` -

Internal implementation details are irrelevant to tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests internal calls (implementation detail)\ndef test_calls_internal_method():\n    service.process()\n    assert service._internal_method.called\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Tests outcome (observable behavior)\ndef test_process_returns_correct_result():\n    result = service.process()\n    assert result.value == expected_value\n```\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Implementation tests break when you refactor (even if behavior is unchanged)\n- Behavior tests survive refactoring\n- You want freedom to improve code without breaking tests\n\n### 3. Unit Tests Stay Isolated\n\nUnit tests never touch external systems—no databases, APIs, file systems, or network calls.\n\n**Mock all outbound dependencies** using interfaces/ports.\n\n**If you cannot isolate a test, stop and raise the issue.** This indicates a design problem.\n\n## Mocking External Dependencies\n\nHexagonal architecture provides **ports** (interfaces) for external systems. Mock the ports, never concrete adapters.\n\n```python\n# ✅ CORRECT: Mock the port interface\nmock_repo = Mock(UserRepository)  # Repository is an interface/port\nmock_repo.find_by_id.return_value = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\nservice = UserService(mock_repo)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")\nassert result.name == \"Alice\"\n\n# ❌ WRONG: Use real adapter\nreal_db = PostgresUserRepository(connection_string)  # External dependency!\nservice = UserService(real_db)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")  # This hits the real database\n```\n\n**If you cannot mock a dependency, the design is wrong.** Stop immediately and raise the issue to the orchestrator.\n\n### Why Mock?\n\n- **Speed**: Unit tests run in milliseconds\n- **Reliability**: No flaky tests due to network/database issues\n- **Isolation**: Test one unit at a time\n- **Independence**: Tests don't depend on external system state\n\n## Writing Effective Tests\n\n### Test One Behavior Per Test\n\nEach test should verify a single behavior. Multiple behaviors require multiple tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests multiple behaviors\ndef test_user_service():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n    deleted = service.delete_user(user.id)\n    assert deleted is True\n\n# ✅ GOOD: One behavior per test\ndef test_create_user_returns_user_with_correct_name():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n\ndef test_update_user_changes_name():\n    user = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n\ndef test_delete_user_returns_true_on_success():\n    deleted = service.delete_user(\"123\")\n    assert deleted is True\n```\n\n### Use Loose Assertions\n\nAvoid brittle tests by using partial matches instead of exact matches.\n\n```python\n# ❌ FRAGILE: Exact string match\nassert message == \"User premium-123 received 10% discount on item ABC\"\n# Breaks if: wording changes, user ID format changes, item name changes\n\n# ✅ ROBUST: Partial matches\nassert \"premium\" in message.lower()\nassert \"discount\" in message\n# Survives: wording changes, formatting changes\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ FRAGILE: Exact structure match\nexpect(result).toEqual({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  email: \"alice@example.com\",\n  created_at: \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  metadata: { ... }\n});\n\n// ✅ ROBUST: Match what matters\nexpect(result).toMatchObject({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\"\n});\nexpect(result.email).toContain(\"@example.com\");\n```\n\n### Avoid Testing Private Methods Directly\n\nPrivate methods are implementation details. Test them indirectly through public APIs.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Testing private method directly\ndef test_calculate_discount_internal():\n    result = service._calculate_discount(100, \"PREMIUM\")\n    assert result == 10\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Test private method through public API\ndef test_premium_users_receive_discount():\n    order = service.process_order(user_type=\"PREMIUM\", amount=100)\n    assert order.total == 90  # 10% discount applied\n```\n\n**Why:** If you refactor and rename/remove `_calculate_discount`, the public behavior test still passes. The private method test breaks.\n\n### Test Edge Cases and Boundaries\n\nDon't just test the happy path. Test:\n\n- **Null/empty inputs**: What happens with `None`, `\"\"`, `[]`?\n- **Boundary values**: Minimum, maximum, just inside/outside limits\n- **Error conditions**: Invalid input, missing data, permissions denied\n- **Edge cases**: Zero, negative numbers, special characters\n\n```python\n# Don't just test:\ndef test_divide_returns_correct_result():\n    assert divide(10, 2) == 5\n\n# Also test:\ndef test_divide_by_zero_raises_error():\n    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n        divide(10, 0)\n\ndef test_divide_with_negative_numbers():\n    assert divide(-10, 2) == -5\n    assert divide(10, -2) == -5\n```\n\n## Test Coverage Goals\n\n### Aim for >90% Behavioral Coverage\n\nPrioritize **behavioral coverage** over **code coverage**.\n\n**Behavioral coverage**: Every requirement in description.md has a test. Every edge case has a test.\n\n**Code coverage**: Percentage of lines executed by tests (this is secondary).\n\n### What to Test\n\n**Always test:**\n- Every requirement from description.md\n- All error handling paths\n- Boundary conditions\n- Edge cases\n\n**Don't obsess over:**\n- Trivial getters/setters (if they literally just return a field)\n- Auto-generated code\n- Framework code you don't own\n\n## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n**❌ Testing private methods directly**\n- Test behavior through public API instead\n\n**❌ Asserting on internal state instead of behavior**\n- Check what the system does, not how it stores data internally\n\n**❌ Using exact string/structure matches**\n- Use partial matches for robustness\n\n**❌ Writing tests after implementation**\n- Test first, always\n\n**❌ Skipping tests for \"simple\" code**\n- Simple code can still have bugs; test it\n\n**❌ Mocking concrete classes instead of interfaces**\n- Mock ports/interfaces, not adapters\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on execution order**\n- Each test should be independent\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on external system state**\n- Mock all external dependencies\n\n**❌ One giant test that tests everything**\n- One test per behavior\n\n## Integration with Hexagonal Architecture\n\nYour codebase likely follows **hexagonal architecture** (ports and adapters pattern).\n\n**Ports**: Interfaces defining contracts with external systems (database, API, file system)\n**Adapters**: Concrete implementations of ports\n\n**In unit tests, mock the ports:**\n\n```typescript\n// Port (interface)\ninterface UserRepository {\n  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;\n  save(user: User): Promise<void>;\n}\n\n// Service depends on port\nclass UserService {\n  constructor(private repo: UserRepository) {}\n\n  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n    const user = await this.repo.findById(id);\n    if (!user) throw new Error(\"User not found\");\n    return user;\n  }\n}\n\n// Test mocks the port\ntest(\"getUser returns user when found\", async () => {\n  const mockRepo: UserRepository = {\n    findById: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: \"123\", name: \"Alice\" }),\n    save: jest.fn()\n  };\n\n  const service = new UserService(mockRepo);\n  const user = await service.getUser(\"123\");\n\n  expect(user.name).toBe(\"Alice\");\n});\n```\n\n**Never mock concrete adapters in unit tests:**\n```typescript\n// ❌ BAD: Using real adapter in unit test\nconst realAdapter = new PostgresUserRepository(config);\nconst service = new UserService(realAdapter);\n// This is now an integration test, not a unit test\n```\n\n## When Testing Reveals Design Issues\n\nIf you cannot write isolated unit tests, this reveals a design problem:\n\n**Problem**: Cannot mock a dependency\n**Cause**: No interface/port exists for the external system\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate to orchestrator (this is an architectural fix)\n\n**Problem**: Test setup is extremely complicated\n**Cause**: Too many dependencies, tight coupling\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (design needs simplification)\n\n**Problem**: Cannot test without real database/API\n**Cause**: Business logic is embedded in adapter layer\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (logic should be in domain/service layer)\n\nDo not attempt to fix these architectural problems yourself. Raise the issue and wait for guidance.\n\n## TDD Workflow Summary\n\nFor every feature/bug/refactor:\n\n1. **Understand the requirement** - What behavior needs to exist?\n2. **Write a failing test** - Describe the behavior in code\n3. **Run the test** - Confirm it fails (red)\n4. **Write minimal implementation** - Just enough to pass\n5. **Run the test** - Confirm it passes (green)\n6. **Refactor** - Improve code quality\n7. **Run the test** - Confirm it still passes\n8. **Repeat** - Until all requirements are met\n\nTest first, always.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7c0dbb17-9b6a-4e65-b1d4-192f28dfc77f","uuid":"e1e48b8a-236f-402b-8c95-67c7b0a3e751","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology\n\nThis guidance is **mandatory** for all implementer work.

If anything is unclear, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 2: Break Down into Testable Units\n\nDecompose the feature into small, independently testable units:\n\n**Example**: \"Implement JWT authentication middleware\"\n\nBreak down:\n1. Token parsing from Authorization header\n2. Token signature validation\n3. Token expiration checking\n4. User context extraction from token\n5. Request rejection on invalid token\n6. Request continuation on valid token\n\nEach unit becomes a test (or set of tests).\n\n### Phase 3: Identify Integration Points\n\nDetermine where your feature integrates with existing code:\n\n- **Inbound**: How does the feature get invoked? (HTTP endpoint, function call, event listener)\n- **Outbound**: What external systems does it interact with? (database, API, cache)\n- **Data structures**: What domain models does it use or create?\n\n**Important**: For outbound dependencies, verify that **ports (interfaces) exist** for mocking. If not, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 4: Test-First Implementation\n\nFor each testable unit:\n\n1. **Write the test first**\n   - Describe the behavior you want\n   - Use mocks for all external dependencies\n   - Test one behavior per test\n\n2. **Watch it fail**\n   - Run the test, confirm it fails (red)\n   - If it passes without implementation, your test is wrong\n\n3. **Write minimal implementation**\n   - Just enough code to make the test pass\n   - Don't over-engineer or add extra features\n\n4. **Watch it pass**\n   - Run the test, confirm it passes (green)\n\n5. **Refactor if needed**\n   - Improve code quality without changing behavior\n   - Run tests again to ensure they still pass\n\n6. **Repeat** for the next unit\n\n### Phase 5: Integration Verification\n\nAfter implementing all units:\n\n1. **Run the full test suite** - Ensure you didn't break existing functionality\n2. **Verify your feature works end-to-end** (if possible in your test environment)\n3. **Check code coverage** - Aim for >90% of your new code\n\n## Feature-Specific Guidance\n\n### Creating New Files vs Modifying Existing\n\n**Create new files when:**\n- Adding a new domain concept or service\n- Implementing a new layer (new adapter, new port)\n- Tests for new code\n\n**Modify existing files when:**\n- Extending existing functionality\n- Adding to an existing service or handler\n- Integrating with existing code\n\n**Rule of thumb**: Follow the existing code organization patterns. If authentication code lives in `pkg/auth/`, your new auth feature should too.\n\n### Working with Existing Code\n\nYour feature likely integrates with existing code:\n\n1. **Read the existing code** - Understand how it works\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style and structure\n3. **Respect abstractions** - Use ports/interfaces, don't bypass them\n4. **Don't refactor while implementing** - That's a separate task\n\nIf existing code is problematic (no testability, tight coupling), stop and escalate. Don't fix architecture issues during feature implementation.\n\n### Incremental Implementation Approach\n\nBuild features incrementally, not all at once:\n\n**✅ Good (incremental):**\n1. Implement token parsing → test → commit\n2. Implement signature validation → test → commit\n3. Implement expiration checking → test → commit\n4. (Continue for each unit)\n\n**❌ Bad (big bang):**\n1. Write all the code for the entire feature\n2. Try to make all tests pass at once\n3. Spend hours debugging\n\nIncremental commits give you:\n- Easier debugging (smaller change sets)\n- Clearer progress\n- Ability to roll back partially if needed\n\n### Documentation\n\nFor new features, update documentation:\n\n1. **Code comments** - Explain non-obvious decisions\n2. **README** - If feature affects usage, update README\n3. **API docs** - If adding public APIs, document them\n\nDon't write extensive design docs (that's the architect's job). Just document **usage** and **non-obvious implementation choices**.\n\n## Common Feature Implementation Pitfalls\n\n**❌ Over-engineering**: Adding flexibility beyond requirements\n- Build what's specified, not what might be needed later (YAGNI)\n\n**❌ Skipping tests**: \"I'll add tests later\"\n- Tests never get added, or you discover your code isn't testable\n\n**❌ Big changes without testing**: Implementing entire feature before running tests\n- When tests fail, you have no idea what's wrong\n\n**❌ Modifying requirements**: \"I think it should work this way instead\"\n- Implement what's specified; propose changes separately\n\n**❌ Refactoring existing code as part of feature work**\n- Mixing refactoring with new features makes review difficult\n\n## Feature Completion Checklist\n\nBefore marking the task as needs_review:\n\n- [ ] All requirements from description.md are implemented\n- [ ] All new code has tests\n- [ ] All tests pass (including existing tests)\n- [ ] Code coverage >90% for new code\n- [ ] No real database/API calls in unit tests (all mocked)\n- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions\n- [ ] Modified files tracked: `sow agent task state add-file <path>`\n- [ ] Actions logged to task log.md\n- [ ] No \"TODO\" or \"FIXME\" comments left in code\n\n## Example: JWT Middleware Implementation\n\n**Requirement**: \"Implement JWT authentication middleware that validates tokens and sets user context\"\n\n**Test-first approach:**\n\n```typescript\n// Test 1: Parsing\ntest(\"extracts token from Authorization header\", () => {\n  const req = { headers: { authorization: \"Bearer abc123\" } };\n  const token = extractToken(req);\n  expect(token).toBe(\"abc123\");\n});\n\n// Implementation 1: Just enough to pass\nfunction extractToken(req): string {\n  const auth = req.headers.authorization;\n  return auth.split(\" \")[1];\n}\n\n// Test 2: Validation\ntest(\"validates token signature\", async () => {\n  const mockVerifier = { verify: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true) };\n  const result = await validateToken(\"valid-token\", mockVerifier);\n  expect(result).toBe(true);\n});\n\n// Implementation 2: Just enough to pass\nasync function validateToken(token, verifier): Promise<boolean> {\n  return await verifier.verify(token);\n}\n\n// Continue for all units...\n```\n\nNotice:\n- Each test is small and focused\n- Implementation is minimal\n- External dependencies (token verifier) are mocked\n- Tests define behavior before implementation exists\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop if:\n- Requirements are ambiguous (which scenarios should be handled?)\n- No interface exists for external dependency (can't mock)\n- Existing code structure prevents proper integration\n- Feature requires architectural changes\n\nDon't guess or make assumptions. Escalate and wait for clarification.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou've loaded the feature implementation guidance. Proceed with:\n\n1. Breaking down your feature into testable units\n2. Writing tests first\n3. Implementing incrementally\n4. Logging your progress\n\nRemember: Test first, always. One unit at a time.

If not, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 4: Test-First Implementation\n\nFor each testable unit:\n\n1. **Write the test first**\n   - Describe the behavior you want\n   - Use mocks for all external dependencies\n   - Test one behavior per test\n\n2. **Watch it fail**\n   - Run the test, confirm it fails (red)\n   - If it passes without implementation, your test is wrong\n\n3. **Write minimal implementation**\n   - Just enough code to make the test pass\n   - Don't over-engineer or add extra features\n\n4. **Watch it pass**\n   - Run the test, confirm it passes (green)\n\n5. **Refactor if needed**\n   - Improve code quality without changing behavior\n   - Run tests again to ensure they still pass\n\n6. **Repeat** for the next unit\n\n### Phase 5: Integration Verification\n\nAfter implementing all units:\n\n1. **Run the full test suite** - Ensure you didn't break existing functionality\n2. **Verify your feature works end-to-end** (if possible in your test environment)\n3. **Check code coverage** - Aim for >90% of your new code\n\n## Feature-Specific Guidance\n\n### Creating New Files vs Modifying Existing\n\n**Create new files when:**\n- Adding a new domain concept or service\n- Implementing a new layer (new adapter, new port)\n- Tests for new code\n\n**Modify existing files when:**\n- Extending existing functionality\n- Adding to an existing service or handler\n- Integrating with existing code\n\n**Rule of thumb**: Follow the existing code organization patterns. If authentication code lives in `pkg/auth/`, your new auth feature should too.\n\n### Working with Existing Code\n\nYour feature likely integrates with existing code:\n\n1. **Read the existing code** - Understand how it works\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style and structure\n3. **Respect abstractions** - Use ports/interfaces, don't bypass them\n4. **Don't refactor while implementing** - That's a separate task\n\nIf existing code is problematic (no testability, tight coupling), stop and escalate. Don't fix architecture issues during feature implementation.\n\n### Incremental Implementation Approach\n\nBuild features incrementally, not all at once:\n\n**✅ Good (incremental):**\n1. Implement token parsing → test → commit\n2. Implement signature validation → test → commit\n3. Implement expiration checking → test → commit\n4. (Continue for each unit)\n\n**❌ Bad (big bang):**\n1. Write all the code for the entire feature\n2. Try to make all tests pass at once\n3. Spend hours debugging\n\nIncremental commits give you:\n- Easier debugging (smaller change sets)\n- Clearer progress\n- Ability to roll back partially if needed\n\n### Documentation\n\nFor new features, update documentation:\n\n1. **Code comments** - Explain non-obvious decisions\n2. **README** - If feature affects usage, update README\n3. **API docs** - If adding public APIs, document them\n\nDon't write extensive design docs (that's the architect's job). Just document **usage** and **non-obvious implementation choices**.\n\n## Common Feature Implementation Pitfalls\n\n**❌ Over-engineering**: Adding flexibility beyond requirements\n- Build what's specified, not what might be needed later (YAGNI)\n\n**❌ Skipping tests**: \"I'll add tests later\"\n- Tests never get added, or you discover your code isn't testable\n\n**❌ Big changes without testing**: Implementing entire feature before running tests\n- When tests fail, you have no idea what's wrong\n\n**❌ Modifying requirements**: \"I think it should work this way instead\"\n- Implement what's specified; propose changes separately\n\n**❌ Refactoring existing code as part of feature work**\n- Mixing refactoring with new features makes review difficult\n\n## Feature Completion Checklist\n\nBefore marking the task as needs_review:\n\n- [ ] All requirements from description.md are implemented\n- [ ] All new code has tests\n- [ ] All tests pass (including existing tests)\n- [ ] Code coverage >90% for new code\n- [ ] No real database/API calls in unit tests (all mocked)\n- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions\n- [ ] Modified files tracked: `sow agent task state add-file <path>`\n- [ ] Actions logged to task log.md\n- [ ] No \"TODO\" or \"FIXME\" comments left in code\n\n## Example: JWT Middleware Implementation\n\n**Requirement**: \"Implement JWT authentication middleware that validates tokens and sets user context\"\n\n**Test-first approach:**\n\n```typescript\n// Test 1: Parsing\ntest(\"extracts token from Authorization header\", () => {\n  const req = { headers: { authorization: \"Bearer abc123\" } };\n  const token = extractToken(req);\n  expect(token).toBe(\"abc123\");\n});\n\n// Implementation 1: Just enough to pass\nfunction extractToken(req): string {\n  const auth = req.headers.authorization;\n  return auth.split(\" \")[1];\n}\n\n// Test 2: Validation\ntest(\"validates token signature\", async () => {\n  const mockVerifier = { verify: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true) };\n  const result = await validateToken(\"valid-token\", mockVerifier);\n  expect(result).toBe(true);\n});\n\n// Implementation 2: Just enough to pass\nasync function validateToken(token, verifier): Promise<boolean> {\n  return await verifier.verify(token);\n}\n\n// Continue for all units...\n```\n\nNotice:\n- Each test is small and focused\n- Implementation is minimal\n- External dependencies (token verifier) are mocked\n- Tests define behavior before implementation exists\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop if:\n- Requirements are ambiguous (which scenarios should be handled?)\n- No interface exists for external dependency (can't mock)\n- Existing code structure prevents proper integration\n- Feature requires architectural changes\n\nDon't guess or make assumptions. Escalate and wait for clarification.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou've loaded the feature implementation guidance. Proceed with:\n\n1. Breaking down your feature into testable units\n2. Writing tests first\n3. Implementing incrementally\n4. Logging your progress\n\nRemember: Test first, always. One unit at a time. Mock external dependencies.","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false}}

Your sole purpose is to implement what is specified—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n## Immediate Actions\n\nFollow these steps in order:\n\n### 1. Read Task State\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/state.yaml`\n\nOr use command: `sow task status --id {id}`\n\nCheck:\n- **iteration**: What iteration are you on? (1 = first attempt, 2+ = addressing feedback)\n- **assigned_agent**: Confirm you're the right agent\n- **inputs**: Context files and feedback the orchestrator wants you to review\n  - Look for inputs with `type: reference` (context files)\n  - Look for inputs with `type: feedback` (review feedback from previous iterations)\n\n### 2. Read Requirements\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/description.md`\n\nUnderstand:\n- What needs to be done\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Any specific constraints or requirements\n- Task scenario type (see detection heuristics below)\n\n**CRITICAL: Validate Task Description Sufficiency**\n\nBefore proceeding, verify the description includes:\n- Context about the overall goal\n- Detailed requirements (NOT just 1-2 sentences)\n- Clear acceptance criteria\n- Technical details (APIs, patterns, file locations)\n- Examples or code snippets (when relevant)\n\n**If the description is insufficient** (e.g., \"Add JWT middleware\" with no details):\n\n1. Log the issue:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: insufficient task description\" -r \"Task description lacks technical details and acceptance criteria needed for implementation\"\n   ```\n\n2. Report back to orchestrator with specifics about what's missing:\n   \"I cannot proceed with this task. The description '{task_name}' is too brief. I need:\n   - Context: What am I building this for?\n   - Requirements: Detailed specifications (algorithm, data structures, etc.)\n   - Acceptance Criteria: How do I know when it's done correctly?\n   - Technical Details: File locations, APIs to use, patterns to follow\n   - Examples: Expected inputs/outputs, code snippets, test cases\"\n\n3. DO NOT attempt to implement based on guesswork\n4. DO NOT proceed without comprehensive requirements\n\nThe orchestrator must provide complete task descriptions. You start with zero context.\n\n### 3. Read Feedback (If Iteration > 1)\n\nIf iteration > 1, check task inputs for feedback artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: feedback`. The most recent feedback will be at:\n`.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/feedback/{iteration-1}.md`\n\nFor example:\n- Iteration 2: Read `feedback/1.md`\n- Iteration 3: Read `feedback/2.md`\n\nEach feedback file contains corrections from the orchestrator. Check the input's metadata for assessment:\n- `metadata.assessment: fail` means you must address the feedback\n- `metadata.assessment: pass` means work was approved (you shouldn't be here)\n\nAddress ALL feedback items before proceeding.\n\n### 4. Load Mandatory TDD Guidance\n\n**ALWAYS run this command:**\n\n```bash\nsow prompt guidance/implementer/tdd\n```\n\nTDD is non-negotiable. You write tests first, always.\n\n### 5. Infer Scenario and Load Appropriate Guidance\n\nRead the description.md content and detect which scenario applies:\n\n**Scenario Detection Heuristics:**\n\n**FEATURE** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"implement\", \"add\", \"create\", \"build\", \"new\", \"develop\", \"write\"\n- OR: Describes new functionality that doesn't exist yet\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/feature`\n\n**BUG** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"fix\", \"bug\", \"issue\", \"broken\", \"not working\", \"error\", \"crash\", \"fails\", \"incorrect\", \"wrong\"\n- OR: References an existing feature that isn't working correctly\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/bug`\n\n**REFACTOR** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"refactor\", \"improve\", \"restructure\", \"clean up\", \"optimize\", \"simplify\", \"reorganize\"\n- OR: Explicitly states behavior should NOT change\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/refactor`\n\n**If ambiguous or unclear:** Default to feature workflow.\n\n### 6. Review Referenced Files\n\nCheck task inputs for reference artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: reference`. Read each referenced file:\n- Architecture docs in `.sow/knowledge/`\n- Style guides or conventions in `.sow/sinks/`\n- Example code in `.sow/repos/`\n- Project-specific context documents\n\nThese provide context the orchestrator wants you to consider.\n\n### 7. Execute Implementation\n\nFollow the workflow defined in the scenario prompt you loaded (feature/bug/refactor).\n\nAll workflows share these principles:\n- **Test first, always**\n- **Implement only what is specified**\n- **Mock external dependencies**\n- **Log your actions**\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Test First, Always\n\nWrite tests before implementation code. No exceptions.\n\nTests define the behavior you must implement. If you can't write a test first, stop and escalate the issue.\n\n### Implement Only What Is Specified\n\nYou do not design. You do not modify requirements. You do not add \"nice to have\" features.\n\nRead description.md and implement exactly what it describes—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n### Your Boundaries\n\n**YOU DO:**\n- Write tests first (TDD)\n- Implement code to make tests pass\n- Refactor for quality without changing behavior\n- Mock external dependencies via ports/interfaces\n- Log all actions to task log.md\n- Work only within your assigned task scope\n- Track modified files using `sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path <path>`\n- Track context used using `sow task input add --id {id} --type reference --path <path>`\n\n**YOU DO NOT:**\n- Change architecture or design decisions\n- Work on tasks other than your assigned task\n- Modify requirements or acceptance criteria\n- Skip writing tests for any reason\n- Use real databases, APIs, or external systems in unit tests\n- Modify files owned by orchestrator (`.sow/project/state.yaml`, project-level log.md)\n- Modify other tasks' files\n\n## Task Completion\n\nWhen implementation is complete:\n\n1. **Run all tests** - Ensure everything passes\n\n2. **Track modified files:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/modified/file.go\"\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/test/file_test.go\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Log final summary** to task log.md\n\n4. **Mark task for review:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task set --id {id} status needs_review\n   ```\n\n5. **Return control to orchestrator** - Your work is done\n\nThe orchestrator will review your changes and either:\n- **Approve**: Sets `status = completed` (task done)\n- **Request changes**: Adds feedback as input, sets `status = in_progress`, increments `iteration` (you'll be restarted)\n\n## Logging Your Work\n\nLog significant actions to help the orchestrator understand what you did:\n\n```bash\nsow agent log -a \"Wrote tests for JWT validation\" -r \"Created 5 test cases covering valid/invalid tokens\" -f middleware/jwt_test.go\nsow agent log -a \"Implemented JWT middleware\" -r \"Validates tokens and sets user context\" -f middleware/jwt.go\nsow agent log -a \"Refactored error handling\" -r \"Consolidated error types into pkg/errors\" -f pkg/errors/errors.go -f middleware/jwt.go\n```\n\nLogs help with:\n- Debugging if something goes wrong\n- Understanding your reasoning during review\n- Resumability if the task needs to be re-run\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop immediately and report to the orchestrator if:\n\n**Design Issues:**\n- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory\n- Cannot write unit tests in isolation (missing interfaces to mock)\n- Implementation requires architectural changes\n- Existing code structure prevents proper testing\n\n**Blockers:**\n- Missing dependencies or unclear context\n- Conflicting feedback from multiple iterations\n- Task depends on another task that isn't complete\n\n**How to Escalate:**\n\n1. Log the blocker clearly:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: missing database interface\" -r \"Cannot mock database calls - no repository interface exists\"\n   ```\n\n2. Mark task appropriately (usually keep as in_progress)\n\n3. Report the blocker to the orchestrator in your response\n\nDo not attempt to fix architectural problems yourself. That is the architect's responsibility.\n\n## Implementation Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- **Writing code before tests** - Always test first\n- **Over-engineering** - Don't add functionality beyond requirements (YAGNI)\n- **Working outside scope** - Don't \"fix\" other issues you notice\n- **Tight coupling** - Respect architectural boundaries\n- **Ignoring feedback** - Address ALL feedback items in subsequent iterations\n- **Silent failures** - If blocked, escalate immediately\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou now have your base instructions. Proceed with steps 1-7 above to begin implementation.\n\nRemember: Load TDD guidance first (mandatory), then load the appropriate scenario guidance based on your task description.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"da9ee9ad-a1c7-4ab9-8111-9c1ef433c0d5","uuid":"680b6ef7-066c-44f0-894e-ea1f9d03c76c","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Implementer Agent - Base Instructions\n\nYou are a software implementer.

TDD is non-negotiable.\n\n## Core TDD Principles\n\n### 1. Test First, Always\n\nWrite tests before writing implementation code. Tests define the behavior you must implement. No exceptions.\n\n**The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**\n\n1. **Red**: Write a failing test\n2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make it pass\n3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality without changing behavior\n4. Repeat\n\n### 2. Test Behavior, Not Implementation\n\nTests verify **what code does**, not **how it does it**.\n\nTest outcomes and public APIs. Internal implementation details are irrelevant to tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests internal calls (implementation detail)\ndef test_calls_internal_method():\n    service.process()\n    assert service._internal_method.called\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Tests outcome (observable behavior)\ndef test_process_returns_correct_result():\n    result = service.process()\n    assert result.value == expected_value\n```\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Implementation tests break when you refactor (even if behavior is unchanged)\n- Behavior tests survive refactoring\n- You want freedom to improve code without breaking tests\n\n### 3. Unit Tests Stay Isolated\n\nUnit tests never touch external systems—no databases, APIs, file systems, or network calls.\n\n**Mock all outbound dependencies** using interfaces/ports.\n\n**If you cannot isolate a test, stop and raise the issue.** This indicates a design problem.\n\n## Mocking External Dependencies\n\nHexagonal architecture provides **ports** (interfaces) for external systems. Mock the ports, never concrete adapters.\n\n```python\n# ✅ CORRECT: Mock the port interface\nmock_repo = Mock(UserRepository)  # Repository is an interface/port\nmock_repo.find_by_id.return_value = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\nservice = UserService(mock_repo)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")\nassert result.name == \"Alice\"\n\n# ❌ WRONG: Use real adapter\nreal_db = PostgresUserRepository(connection_string)  # External dependency!\nservice = UserService(real_db)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")  # This hits the real database\n```\n\n**If you cannot mock a dependency, the design is wrong.** Stop immediately and raise the issue to the orchestrator.\n\n### Why Mock?\n\n- **Speed**: Unit tests run in milliseconds\n- **Reliability**: No flaky tests due to network/database issues\n- **Isolation**: Test one unit at a time\n- **Independence**: Tests don't depend on external system state\n\n## Writing Effective Tests\n\n### Test One Behavior Per Test\n\nEach test should verify a single behavior. Multiple behaviors require multiple tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests multiple behaviors\ndef test_user_service():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n    deleted = service.delete_user(user.id)\n    assert deleted is True\n\n# ✅ GOOD: One behavior per test\ndef test_create_user_returns_user_with_correct_name():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n\ndef test_update_user_changes_name():\n    user = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n\ndef test_delete_user_returns_true_on_success():\n    deleted = service.delete_user(\"123\")\n    assert deleted is True\n```\n\n### Use Loose Assertions\n\nAvoid brittle tests by using partial matches instead of exact matches.\n\n```python\n# ❌ FRAGILE: Exact string match\nassert message == \"User premium-123 received 10% discount on item ABC\"\n# Breaks if: wording changes, user ID format changes, item name changes\n\n# ✅ ROBUST: Partial matches\nassert \"premium\" in message.lower()\nassert \"discount\" in message\n# Survives: wording changes, formatting changes\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ FRAGILE: Exact structure match\nexpect(result).toEqual({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  email: \"alice@example.com\",\n  created_at: \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  metadata: { ... }\n});\n\n// ✅ ROBUST: Match what matters\nexpect(result).toMatchObject({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\"\n});\nexpect(result.email).toContain(\"@example.com\");\n```\n\n### Avoid Testing Private Methods Directly\n\nPrivate methods are implementation details. Test them indirectly through public APIs.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Testing private method directly\ndef test_calculate_discount_internal():\n    result = service._calculate_discount(100, \"PREMIUM\")\n    assert result == 10\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Test private method through public API\ndef test_premium_users_receive_discount():\n    order = service.process_order(user_type=\"PREMIUM\", amount=100)\n    assert order.total == 90  # 10% discount applied\n```\n\n**Why:** If you refactor and rename/remove `_calculate_discount`, the public behavior test still passes. The private method test breaks.\n\n### Test Edge Cases and Boundaries\n\nDon't just test the happy path. Test:\n\n- **Null/empty inputs**: What happens with `None`, `\"\"`, `[]`?\n- **Boundary values**: Minimum, maximum, just inside/outside limits\n- **Error conditions**: Invalid input, missing data, permissions denied\n- **Edge cases**: Zero, negative numbers, special characters\n\n```python\n# Don't just test:\ndef test_divide_returns_correct_result():\n    assert divide(10, 2) == 5\n\n# Also test:\ndef test_divide_by_zero_raises_error():\n    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n        divide(10, 0)\n\ndef test_divide_with_negative_numbers():\n    assert divide(-10, 2) == -5\n    assert divide(10, -2) == -5\n```\n\n## Test Coverage Goals\n\n### Aim for >90% Behavioral Coverage\n\nPrioritize **behavioral coverage** over **code coverage**.\n\n**Behavioral coverage**: Every requirement in description.md has a test. Every edge case has a test.\n\n**Code coverage**: Percentage of lines executed by tests (this is secondary).\n\n### What to Test\n\n**Always test:**\n- Every requirement from description.md\n- All error handling paths\n- Boundary conditions\n- Edge cases\n\n**Don't obsess over:**\n- Trivial getters/setters (if they literally just return a field)\n- Auto-generated code\n- Framework code you don't own\n\n## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n**❌ Testing private methods directly**\n- Test behavior through public API instead\n\n**❌ Asserting on internal state instead of behavior**\n- Check what the system does, not how it stores data internally\n\n**❌ Using exact string/structure matches**\n- Use partial matches for robustness\n\n**❌ Writing tests after implementation**\n- Test first, always\n\n**❌ Skipping tests for \"simple\" code**\n- Simple code can still have bugs; test it\n\n**❌ Mocking concrete classes instead of interfaces**\n- Mock ports/interfaces, not adapters\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on execution order**\n- Each test should be independent\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on external system state**\n- Mock all external dependencies\n\n**❌ One giant test that tests everything**\n- One test per behavior\n\n## Integration with Hexagonal Architecture\n\nYour codebase likely follows **hexagonal architecture** (ports and adapters pattern).\n\n**Ports**: Interfaces defining contracts with external systems (database, API, file system)\n**Adapters**: Concrete implementations of ports\n\n**In unit tests, mock the ports:**\n\n```typescript\n// Port (interface)\ninterface UserRepository {\n  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;\n  save(user: User): Promise<void>;\n}\n\n// Service depends on port\nclass UserService {\n  constructor(private repo: UserRepository) {}\n\n  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n    const user = await this.repo.findById(id);\n    if (!user) throw new Error(\"User not found\");\n    return user;\n  }\n}\n\n// Test mocks the port\ntest(\"getUser returns user when found\", async () => {\n  const mockRepo: UserRepository = {\n    findById: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: \"123\", name: \"Alice\" }),\n    save: jest.fn()\n  };\n\n  const service = new UserService(mockRepo);\n  const user = await service.getUser(\"123\");\n\n  expect(user.name).toBe(\"Alice\");\n});\n```\n\n**Never mock concrete adapters in unit tests:**\n```typescript\n// ❌ BAD: Using real adapter in unit test\nconst realAdapter = new PostgresUserRepository(config);\nconst service = new UserService(realAdapter);\n// This is now an integration test, not a unit test\n```\n\n## When Testing Reveals Design Issues\n\nIf you cannot write isolated unit tests, this reveals a design problem:\n\n**Problem**: Cannot mock a dependency\n**Cause**: No interface/port exists for the external system\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate to orchestrator (this is an architectural fix)\n\n**Problem**: Test setup is extremely complicated\n**Cause**: Too many dependencies, tight coupling\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (design needs simplification)\n\n**Problem**: Cannot test without real database/API\n**Cause**: Business logic is embedded in adapter layer\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (logic should be in domain/service layer)\n\nDo not attempt to fix these architectural problems yourself. Raise the issue and wait for guidance.\n\n## TDD Workflow Summary\n\nFor every feature/bug/refactor:\n\n1. **Understand the requirement** - What behavior needs to exist?\n2. **Write a failing test** - Describe the behavior in code\n3. **Run the test** - Confirm it fails (red)\n4. **Write minimal implementation** - Just enough to pass\n5. **Run the test** - Confirm it passes (green)\n6. **Refactor** - Improve code quality\n7. **Run the test** - Confirm it still passes\n8. **Repeat** - Until all requirements are met\n\nTest first, always.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"da9ee9ad-a1c7-4ab9-8111-9c1ef433c0d5","uuid":"49536092-3d04-4673-8d18-8f88d22bb65a","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology\n\nThis guidance is **mandatory** for all implementer work.

If anything is unclear, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 2: Break Down into Testable Units\n\nDecompose the feature into small, independently testable units:\n\n**Example**: \"Implement JWT authentication middleware\"\n\nBreak down:\n1. Token parsing from Authorization header\n2. Token signature validation\n3. Token expiration checking\n4. User context extraction from token\n5. Request rejection on invalid token\n6. Request continuation on valid token\n\nEach unit becomes a test (or set of tests).\n\n### Phase 3: Identify Integration Points\n\nDetermine where your feature integrates with existing code:\n\n- **Inbound**: How does the feature get invoked?

(database, API, cache)\n- **Data structures**: What domain models does it use or create?\n\n**Important**: For outbound dependencies, verify that **ports (interfaces) exist** for mocking. If not, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 4: Test-First Implementation\n\nFor each testable unit:\n\n1. **Write the test first**\n   - Describe the behavior you want\n   - Use mocks for all external dependencies\n   - Test one behavior per test\n\n2. **Watch it fail**\n   - Run the test, confirm it fails (red)\n   - If it passes without implementation, your test is wrong\n\n3. **Write minimal implementation**\n   - Just enough code to make the test pass\n   - Don't over-engineer or add extra features\n\n4. **Watch it pass**\n   - Run the test, confirm it passes (green)\n\n5. **Refactor if needed**\n   - Improve code quality without changing behavior\n   - Run tests again to ensure they still pass\n\n6. **Repeat** for the next unit\n\n### Phase 5: Integration Verification\n\nAfter implementing all units:\n\n1. **Run the full test suite** - Ensure you didn't break existing functionality\n2. **Verify your feature works end-to-end** (if possible in your test environment)\n3. **Check code coverage** - Aim for >90% of your new code\n\n## Feature-Specific Guidance\n\n### Creating New Files vs Modifying Existing\n\n**Create new files when:**\n- Adding a new domain concept or service\n- Implementing a new layer (new adapter, new port)\n- Tests for new code\n\n**Modify existing files when:**\n- Extending existing functionality\n- Adding to an existing service or handler\n- Integrating with existing code\n\n**Rule of thumb**: Follow the existing code organization patterns. If authentication code lives in `pkg/auth/`, your new auth feature should too.\n\n### Working with Existing Code\n\nYour feature likely integrates with existing code:\n\n1. **Read the existing code** - Understand how it works\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style and structure\n3. **Respect abstractions** - Use ports/interfaces, don't bypass them\n4. **Don't refactor while implementing** - That's a separate task\n\nIf existing code is problematic (no testability, tight coupling), stop and escalate. Don't fix architecture issues during feature implementation.\n\n### Incremental Implementation Approach\n\nBuild features incrementally, not all at once:\n\n**✅ Good (incremental):**\n1. Implement token parsing → test → commit\n2. Implement signature validation → test → commit\n3. Implement expiration checking → test → commit\n4. (Continue for each unit)\n\n**❌ Bad (big bang):**\n1.

([docs.divio.com][2])\n* **Badges**: keep to essentials (CI, release, license) only.\n\n## Positive / Negative Reinforcement\n\n**Do (Positive):**\n\n* **Lead with value**: “CLI to diff Kubernetes manifests with policy checks.” ([GitHub Docs][1])\n* **Provide a 60-second proof**: one install + one command that works.\n* **Separate concerns**: tutorial vs how-to vs reference vs explanation. ([docs.divio.com][2])\n* **Use a human-readable changelog** and note SemVer. ([keepachangelog.com][4])\n\n**Avoid (Negative):**\n\n* ❌ Wall-of-text intros or marketing copy before the Quick Start.\n* ❌ Mixing tutorial prose with API reference in the README (link instead). ([docs.divio.com][2])\n* ❌ Long release notes inside the README (use CHANGELOG). ([keepachangelog.com][4])\n* ❌ Passive voice and vague steps (“It can be installed by…”). ([Google for Developers][5])\n\n---\n\n## Example README (Modern, Minimal)\n\n````markdown\n# FluxDiff\n\nCLI to diff Kubernetes manifests and flag policy violations before deploys.\n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\n# Prerequisites: kubectl v1.30+, Go 1.22+ (for source builds)\ncurl -L https://github.com/acme/fluxdiff/releases/latest/download/fluxdiff_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/fluxdiff\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/fluxdiff\n\n# Hello world: diff two folders and print a summary\nfluxdiff diff ./manifests/dev ./manifests/prod\n````\n\n## Usage\n\nCommon tasks:\n\n```bash\n# 1) Show only breaking changes (delete/replace)\nfluxdiff diff a b --severity=breaking\n\n# 2) Enforce policy (blocks noncompliant changes)\nfluxdiff diff a b --policy ./policy.rego --fail-on=violation\n\n# 3) Output formats for CI (table, json)\nfluxdiff diff a b --output=json > report.json\n```\n\nMore examples → **docs/how-to**.\n\n## Configuration\n\n| Option       | Default | Description                    |\n| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------ |\n| `--policy`   | none    | Rego policy file(s) to enforce |\n| `--severity` | all     | `all` | `breaking` | `safety`  |\n| `--output`   | table   | `table` | `json`               |\n\nSee full reference → **docs/reference**.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* `command not found`: Ensure the binary is executable and on `$PATH`.\n* “kubeconfig not found”: Set `KUBECONFIG` or run `kubectl config view`.\n* CI fails with `exit 2`: A violation was found; re-run with `--output=json` to inspect.\n\nMore fixes → **docs/faq**.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome issues and PRs.

Write clear, straightforward code**\n     8→   - Prioritize readability over showcasing language features\n     9→   - Example:\n    10→     ```go\n    11→     // BAD: Clever one-liner\n    12→     return len(s) > 0 && s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n    13→\n    14→     // GOOD: Clear and explicit\n    15→     if len(s) == 0 {\n    16→         return false\n    17→     }\n    18→     return s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n    19→     ```\n    20→\n    21→2. **Make zero values useful - Design types so their zero value is valid and usable**\n    22→   - Example:\n    23→     ```go\n    24→     // BAD: Requires constructor\n    25→     type Buffer struct {\n    26→         data []byte\n    27→         size int\n    28→     }\n    29→\n    30→     // GOOD: Zero value ready to use\n    31→     type Buffer struct {\n    32→         data []byte\n    33→     }\n    34→     func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) {\n    35→         b.data = append(b.data, p...)  // Works with nil slice\n    36→     }\n    37→     ```\n    38→\n    39→3. **Accept interfaces, return concrete types**\n    40→   - Example:\n    41→     ```go\n    42→     // BAD\n    43→     func NewCache(size int) Cache\n    44→\n    45→     // GOOD\n    46→     func NewCache(size int) *MemoryCache\n    47→     func ProcessData(r io.Reader) error\n    48→     ```\n    49→\n    50→4. **Don't panic in library code - Return errors instead**\n    51→   - Acceptable: `init()`, `main` package, impossible conditions\n    52→   - Example:\n    53→     ```go\n    54→     // BAD\n    55→     func ParseConfig(data []byte) Config {\n    56→         var cfg Config\n    57→         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n    58→             panic(err)\n    59→         }\n    60→         return cfg\n    61→     }\n    62→\n    63→     // GOOD\n    64→     func ParseConfig(data []byte) (Config, error) {\n    65→         var cfg Config\n    66→         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n    67→             return Config{}, fmt.Errorf(\"parse config: %w\", err)\n    68→         }\n    69→         return cfg, nil\n    70→     }\n    71→     ```\n    72→\n    73→5. **Avoid global mutable state**\n    74→   - Use dependency injection\n    75→   - Constants and package-level defaults are acceptable\n    76→   - Example:\n    77→     ```go\n    78→     // BAD\n    79→     var defaultClient *http.Client\n    80→     func FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n    81→\n    82→     // GOOD\n    83→     type Fetcher struct {\n    84→         client *http.Client\n    85→     }\n    86→     func (f *Fetcher) FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n    87→     ```\n    88→\n    89→6. **Explicit is better than implicit - No magic behavior**\n    90→   - Example:\n    91→     ```go\n    92→     // BAD: Hidden side effect\n    93→     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string {\n    94→         if time.Since(c.lastCleanup) > time.Hour {\n    95→             c.cleanup()  // Surprise!\n    96→         }\n    97→         return c.data[key]\n    98→     }\n    99→\n   100→     // GOOD: Explicit operations\n   101→     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string\n   102→     func (c *Cache) Cleanup()\n   103→     ```\n   104→\n   105→7. **Never re-implement functionality from the standard library**\n   106→   - Exception: Document performance/feature requirements\n   107→   - Example:\n   108→     ```go\n   109→     // BAD\n   110→     func trimWhitespace(s string) string { /* custom impl */ }\n   111→\n   112→     // GOOD\n   113→     result := strings.TrimSpace(s)\n   114→     ```\n   115→\n   116→## Code Organization\n   117→\n   118→1. **Package structure: One package per directory, name matches directory**\n   119→   - Package names: short, lowercase, singular\n   120→   - Avoid: `util`, `common`, `helper`, underscores, mixed caps\n   121→   - Example:\n   122→     ```\n   123→     myproject/\n   124→     ├── handler/    # package handler\n   125→     ├── storage/    # package storage\n   126→     └── api/        # package api\n   127→     ```\n   128→\n   129→2. **Organize by domain, not technical layer**\n   130→   - Example:\n   131→     ```\n   132→     // BAD\n   133→     myproject/\n   134→     ├── models/\n   135→     ├── controllers/\n   136→     └── repositories/\n   137→\n   138→     // GOOD\n   139→     myproject/\n   140→     ├── user/\n   141→     │   ├── user.go\n   142→     │   ├── handler.go\n   143→     │   └── storage.go\n   144→     ├── product/\n   145→     └── order/\n   146→     ```\n   147→\n   148→3. **Always use `cmd/` directory for binaries (even single binary)**\n   149→   - Keep `main` minimal: flag parsing, config, dependency wiring only\n   150→   - All business logic in importable packages\n   151→   - Example:\n   152→     ```\n   153→     myproject/\n   154→     ├── cmd/\n   155→     │   └── server/\n   156→     │       └── main.go\n   157→     ├── handler/\n   158→     └── storage/\n   159→     ```\n   160→\n   161→4. **Use `internal/` for non-exported packages**\n   162→   - Example:\n   163→     ```\n   164→     myproject/\n   165→     ├── api/              # Exported\n   166→     └── internal/\n   167→         ├── config/       # Cannot be imported externally\n   168→         └── database/\n   169→     ```\n   170→\n   171→5. **Import grouping: stdlib, external, internal**\n   172→   - Use `goimports` for automatic formatting\n   173→   - Example:\n   174→     ```go\n   175→     import (\n   176→         \"context\"\n   177→         \"fmt\"\n   178→\n   179→         \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n   180→\n   181→         \"myproject/internal/config\"\n   182→     )\n   183→     ```\n   184→\n   185→6. **Keep package depth to 2-3 levels maximum**\n   186→   - Example:\n   187→     ```go\n   188→     // BAD\n   189→     import \"myproject/internal/services/user/handler/http/v1\"\n   190→\n   191→     // GOOD\n   192→     import \"myproject/internal/user\"\n   193→     ```\n   194→\n   195→7. **Use `doc.go` for complex package documentation**\n   196→   - Example:\n   197→     ```go\n   198→     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers.\n   199→     //\n   200→     // Example:\n   201→     //     h := handler.New(storage)\n   202→     //     http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", h.ListUsers)\n   203→     package handler\n   204→     ```\n   205→\n   206→8. **Organize code within files in this order**\n   207→   - Imports\n   208→   - Constants\n   209→   - Type declarations (non-structs)\n   210→   - Interfaces\n   211→   - Structs\n   212→   - Struct constructors\n   213→   - Struct public methods (alphabetized)\n   214→   - Struct private methods (alphabetized)\n   215→   - Public functions (alphabetized)\n   216→   - Private functions (alphabetized)\n   217→   - Example:\n   218→     ```go\n   219→     package user\n   220→\n   221→     import (\n   222→         \"context\"\n   223→         \"errors\"\n   224→     )\n   225→\n   226→     const MaxNameLength = 100\n   227→\n   228→     type Role string\n   229→\n   230→     type Storage interface {\n   231→         Save(ctx context.Context, u *User) error\n   232→     }\n   233→\n   234→     type User struct {\n   235→         id    string\n   236→         email string\n   237→     }\n   238→\n   239→     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n   240→         return &User{email: email}\n   241→     }\n   242→\n   243→     func (u *User) Email() string {\n   244→         return u.email\n   245→     }\n   246→\n   247→     func (u *User) Validate() error {\n   248→         return u.validate()\n   249→     }\n   250→\n   251→     func (u *User) validate() error {\n   252→         if u.email == \"\" {\n   253→             return errors.New(\"email required\")\n   254→         }\n   255→         return nil\n   256→     }\n   257→\n   258→     func FormatEmail(email string) string {\n   259→         return strings.ToLower(email)\n   260→     }\n   261→\n   262→     func validateDomain(email string) bool {\n   263→         // ...\n   264→     }\n   265→     ```\n   266→\n   267→## Naming Conventions\n   268→\n   269→1. **Variable names: short for small scope, descriptive for large scope**\n   270→   - Example:\n   271→     ```go\n   272→     // GOOD\n   273→     for i := 0; i < len(items); i++ { }\n   274→     for _, user := range users { }\n   275→\n   276→     func ProcessOrder(customerID string) error {\n   277→         var totalPrice float64\n   278→         var validationErrors []error\n   279→         // ...\n   280→     }\n   281→\n   282→     // BAD\n   283→     for indexCounter := 0; indexCounter < len(items); indexCounter++ { }\n   284→     func ProcessOrder(cid string) error {\n   285→         var tp float64\n   286→         var ve []error\n   287→     }\n   288→     ```\n   289→\n   290→2. **Use MixedCaps/mixedCaps, never underscores or ALL_CAPS**\n   291→   - Example:\n   292→     ```go\n   293→     // BAD\n   294→     type user_service struct{}\n   295→     const MAX_RETRY = 3\n   296→\n   297→     // GOOD\n   298→     type UserService struct{}\n   299→     const MaxRetry = 3\n   300→     ```\n   301→\n   302→3. **Acronyms: all uppercase or all lowercase**\n   303→   - Example:\n   304→     ```go\n   305→     // BAD\n   306→     type HttpServer struct{}\n   307→     var userId string\n   308→\n   309→     // GOOD\n   310→     type HTTPServer struct{}\n   311→     var userID string\n   312→     ```\n   313→\n   314→4. **Interfaces: describe behavior, often -er suffix**\n   315→   - Avoid: `Interface`, `Manager`, `Helper`, `I` prefix\n   316→   - Example:\n   317→     ```go\n   318→     // GOOD\n   319→     type Reader interface\n   320→     type Validator interface\n   321→     type Storage interface\n   322→\n   323→     // BAD\n   324→     type IReader interface\n   325→     type ReaderInterface interface\n   326→     ```\n   327→\n   328→5. **Avoid package name stuttering**\n   329→   - Example:\n   330→     ```go\n   331→     // BAD: package user\n   332→     type UserService struct{}\n   333→\n   334→     // GOOD: package user\n   335→     type Service struct{}\n   336→     // Used as: user.Service\n   337→     ```\n   338→\n   339→6. **Receiver names: short (1-2 chars), consistent**\n   340→   - Avoid: `this`, `self`, `me`\n   341→   - Example:\n   342→     ```go\n   343→     // GOOD\n   344→     func (u *User) SetName(name string)\n   345→     func (u *User) Name() string\n   346→\n   347→     // BAD\n   348→     func (user *User) SetName(name string)\n   349→     func (this *User) Name() string\n   350→     ```\n   351→\n   352→7. **Function names: verbs; Getters omit 'Get'; Errors use 'Err' prefix**\n   353→   -

Common tags: `json`, `yaml`, `db`, `validate`\n   796→   - Be consistent with naming conventions\n   797→   - Example:\n   798→     ```go\n   799→     type User struct {\n   800→         ID        string    `json:\"id\" db:\"user_id\"`\n   801→         Email     string    `json:\"email\" db:\"email\" validate:\"required,email\"`\n   802→         CreatedAt time.Time `json:\"created_at\" db:\"created_at\"`\n   803→         UpdatedAt time.Time `json:\"updated_at\" db:\"updated_at\"`\n   804→     }\n   805→     ```\n   806→\n   807→7. **Don't export unnecessary fields - prefer getter methods when needed**\n   808→   - Unexported fields allow you to change internal representation\n   809→   - Exported fields become part of your API\n   810→   - Example:\n   811→     ```go\n   812→     // BAD: Exposes internal state\n   813→     type Cache struct {\n   814→         Data map[string]interface{}\n   815→         Mu   sync.RWMutex\n   816→     }\n   817→\n   818→     // GOOD: Encapsulates internals\n   819→     type Cache struct {\n   820→         data map[string]interface{}\n   821→         mu   sync.RWMutex\n   822→     }\n   823→\n   824→     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {\n   825→         c.mu.RLock()\n   826→         defer c.mu.RUnlock()\n   827→         val, ok := c.data[key]\n   828→         return val, ok\n   829→     }\n   830→     ```\n   831→\n   832→## Comments & Documentation\n   833→\n   834→1. **All exported identifiers must have doc comments**\n   835→   - Start with the identifier name\n   836→   - Use complete sentences\n   837→   - Example:\n   838→     ```go\n   839→     // GOOD\n   840→     // User represents a user account in the system.\n   841→     type User struct {\n   842→         ID    string\n   843→         Email string\n   844→     }\n   845→\n   846→     // NewUser creates a new user with the given email.\n   847→     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n   848→         return &User{Email: email}\n   849→     }\n   850→\n   851→     // BAD\n   852→     // user struct\n   853→     type User struct{}\n   854→\n   855→     // creates a user\n   856→     func NewUser(email string) *User\n   857→     ```\n   858→\n   859→2. **Package comment should describe the package purpose**\n   860→   - Place in `doc.go` or at the top of any file in the package\n   861→   - Start with \"Package <name>\"\n   862→   - Example:\n   863→     ```go\n   864→     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers for the user API.\n   865→     //\n   866→     // The handlers support JSON request/response formats and include\n   867→     // built-in validation and error handling.\n   868→     package handler\n   869→     ```\n   870→\n   871→4. **Use TODO comments with issue references**\n   872→   - Format: `// TODO(#issue): description`\n   873→   - Always link to an issue or ticket\n   874→   - Example:\n   875→     ```go\n   876→     // GOOD\n   877→     // TODO(#123): Add support for pagination\n   878→     // TODO(alice): Optimize this query for large datasets\n   879→\n   880→     // BAD\n   881→     // TODO: fix this later\n   882→     // FIXME\n   883→     ```\n   884→\n   885→5. **Use examples in doc comments for complex APIs**\n   886→   - Example:\n   887→     ```go\n   888→     // ProcessBatch processes multiple items in parallel.\n   889→     //\n   890→     // Example:\n   891→     //\n   892→     //     items := []Item{{ID: \"1\"}, {ID: \"2\"}}\n   893→     //     results, err := ProcessBatch(ctx, items, 10)\n   894→     //     if err != nil {\n   895→     //         log.Fatal(err)\n   896→     //     }\n   897→     //\n   898→     func ProcessBatch(ctx context.Context, items []Item, workers int) ([]Result, error)\n   899→     ```\n   900→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Write clear, straightforward code**\n   - Prioritize readability over showcasing language features\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Clever one-liner\n     return len(s) > 0 && s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n\n     // GOOD: Clear and explicit\n     if len(s) == 0 {\n         return false\n     }\n     return s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n     ```\n\n2. **Make zero values useful - Design types so their zero value is valid and usable**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Requires constructor\n     type Buffer struct {\n         data []byte\n         size int\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Zero value ready to use\n     type Buffer struct {\n         data []byte\n     }\n     func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) {\n         b.data = append(b.data, p...)  // Works with nil slice\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Accept interfaces, return concrete types**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func NewCache(size int) Cache\n\n     // GOOD\n     func NewCache(size int) *MemoryCache\n     func ProcessData(r io.Reader) error\n     ```\n\n4. **Don't panic in library code - Return errors instead**\n   - Acceptable: `init()`, `main` package, impossible conditions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func ParseConfig(data []byte) Config {\n         var cfg Config\n         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n             panic(err)\n         }\n         return cfg\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     func ParseConfig(data []byte) (Config, error) {\n         var cfg Config\n         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n             return Config{}, fmt.Errorf(\"parse config: %w\", err)\n         }\n         return cfg, nil\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Avoid global mutable state**\n   - Use dependency injection\n   - Constants and package-level defaults are acceptable\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     var defaultClient *http.Client\n     func FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n\n     // GOOD\n     type Fetcher struct {\n         client *http.Client\n     }\n     func (f *Fetcher) FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n     ```\n\n6. **Explicit is better than implicit - No magic behavior**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Hidden side effect\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string {\n         if time.Since(c.lastCleanup) > time.Hour {\n             c.cleanup()  // Surprise!\n         }\n         return c.data[key]\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Explicit operations\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string\n     func (c *Cache) Cleanup()\n     ```\n\n7. **Never re-implement functionality from the standard library**\n   - Exception: Document performance/feature requirements\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func trimWhitespace(s string) string { /* custom impl */ }\n\n     // GOOD\n     result := strings.TrimSpace(s)\n     ```\n\n## Code Organization\n\n1. **Package structure: One package per directory, name matches directory**\n   - Package names: short, lowercase, singular\n   - Avoid: `util`, `common`, `helper`, underscores, mixed caps\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── handler/    # package handler\n     ├── storage/    # package storage\n     └── api/        # package api\n     ```\n\n2. **Organize by domain, not technical layer**\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     // BAD\n     myproject/\n     ├── models/\n     ├── controllers/\n     └── repositories/\n\n     // GOOD\n     myproject/\n     ├── user/\n     │   ├── user.go\n     │   ├── handler.go\n     │   └── storage.go\n     ├── product/\n     └── order/\n     ```\n\n3. **Always use `cmd/` directory for binaries (even single binary)**\n   - Keep `main` minimal: flag parsing, config, dependency wiring only\n   - All business logic in importable packages\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── cmd/\n     │   └── server/\n     │       └── main.go\n     ├── handler/\n     └── storage/\n     ```\n\n4. **Use `internal/` for non-exported packages**\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── api/              # Exported\n     └── internal/\n         ├── config/       # Cannot be imported externally\n         └── database/\n     ```\n\n5. **Import grouping: stdlib, external, internal**\n   - Use `goimports` for automatic formatting\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     import (\n         \"context\"\n         \"fmt\"\n\n         \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n\n         \"myproject/internal/config\"\n     )\n     ```\n\n6. **Keep package depth to 2-3 levels maximum**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     import \"myproject/internal/services/user/handler/http/v1\"\n\n     // GOOD\n     import \"myproject/internal/user\"\n     ```\n\n7. **Use `doc.go` for complex package documentation**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers.\n     //\n     // Example:\n     //     h := handler.New(storage)\n     //     http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", h.ListUsers)\n     package handler\n     ```\n\n8. **Organize code within files in this order**\n   - Imports\n   - Constants\n   - Type declarations (non-structs)\n   - Interfaces\n   - Structs\n   - Struct constructors\n   - Struct public methods (alphabetized)\n   - Struct private methods (alphabetized)\n   - Public functions (alphabetized)\n   - Private functions (alphabetized)\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     package user\n\n     import (\n         \"context\"\n         \"errors\"\n     )\n\n     const MaxNameLength = 100\n\n     type Role string\n\n     type Storage interface {\n         Save(ctx context.Context, u *User) error\n     }\n\n     type User struct {\n         id    string\n         email string\n     }\n\n     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n         return &User{email: email}\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) Email() string {\n         return u.email\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) Validate() error {\n         return u.validate()\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) validate() error {\n         if u.email == \"\" {\n             return errors.New(\"email required\")\n         }\n         return nil\n     }\n\n     func FormatEmail(email string) string {\n         return strings.ToLower(email)\n     }\n\n     func validateDomain(email string) bool {\n         // ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n1. **Variable names: short for small scope, descriptive for large scope**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     for i := 0; i < len(items); i++ { }\n     for _, user := range users { }\n\n     func ProcessOrder(customerID string) error {\n         var totalPrice float64\n         var validationErrors []error\n         // ...\n     }\n\n     // BAD\n     for indexCounter := 0; indexCounter < len(items); indexCounter++ { }\n     func ProcessOrder(cid string) error {\n         var tp float64\n         var ve []error\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use MixedCaps/mixedCaps, never underscores or ALL_CAPS**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     type user_service struct{}\n     const MAX_RETRY = 3\n\n     // GOOD\n     type UserService struct{}\n     const MaxRetry = 3\n     ```\n\n3. **Acronyms: all uppercase or all lowercase**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     type HttpServer struct{}\n     var userId string\n\n     // GOOD\n     type HTTPServer struct{}\n     var userID string\n     ```\n\n4. **Interfaces: describe behavior, often -er suffix**\n   - Avoid: `Interface`, `Manager`, `Helper`, `I` prefix\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     type Reader interface\n     type Validator interface\n     type Storage interface\n\n     // BAD\n     type IReader interface\n     type ReaderInterface interface\n     ```\n\n5. **Avoid package name stuttering**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: package user\n     type UserService struct{}\n\n     // GOOD: package user\n     type Service struct{}\n     // Used as: user.Service\n     ```\n\n6. **Receiver names: short (1-2 chars), consistent**\n   - Avoid: `this`, `self`, `me`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func (u *User) SetName(name string)\n     func (u *User) Name() string\n\n     // BAD\n     func (user *User) SetName(name string)\n     func (this *User) Name() string\n     ```\n\n7. **Function names: verbs; Getters omit 'Get'; Errors use 'Err' prefix**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Functions\n     func ParseConfig() (*Config, error)\n     func IsValid() bool\n\n     // Getters/Setters\n     func (u *User) Name() string          // Not GetName\n     func (u *User) SetName(name string)\n\n     // Errors\n     var ErrNotFound = errors.New(\"not found\")\n     type ValidationError struct{}\n     ```\n\n## Functions & Methods\n\n1. **Keep functions small (50-80 lines) and single-purpose**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Does fetch, validate, email, analytics\n     func ProcessUser(userID string) error { /* 100 lines */ }\n\n     // GOOD: Split into focused functions\n     func ProcessUser(userID string) error {\n         user, err := fetchUser(userID)\n         // ...\n         if err := validateUser(user); err != nil\n         if err := sendWelcomeEmail(user); err != nil\n         trackUserProcessing(user.ID)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use early returns to reduce nesting**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func Process(r *Request) error {\n         if r != nil {\n             if r.IsValid() {\n                 if r.User != nil {\n                     return process(r)\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     func Process(r *Request) error {\n         if r == nil {\n             return errors.New(\"request is nil\")\n         }\n         if !r.IsValid() {\n             return errors.New(\"invalid\")\n         }\n         if r.User == nil {\n             return errors.New(\"no user\")\n         }\n         return process(r)\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use pointer receivers by default for consistency**\n   - Exception: Small immutable types (Point, Color)\n   - Be consistent: if one method needs pointer, all methods use pointers\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type UserService struct { db *sql.DB }\n\n     func (s *UserService) GetUser(id string) (*User, error)\n     func (s *UserService) UpdateUser(user *User) error\n     ```\n\n4. **Parameter order: ctx first, required before optional, errors last**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func FetchUser(ctx context.Context, userID string, opts *Options) (*User, error)\n\n     // BAD\n     func FetchUser(opts *Options, userID string, ctx context.Context) (error, *User)\n     ```\n\n5. **Use functional options pattern for many optional parameters**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type ServerOption func(*Server)\n\n     func WithTimeout(d time.Duration) ServerOption {\n         return func(s *Server) { s.timeout = d }\n     }\n\n     func NewServer(addr string, opts ...ServerOption) *Server {\n         s := &Server{addr: addr, timeout: 30 * time.Second}\n         for _, opt := range opts {\n             opt(s)\n         }\n         return s\n     }\n\n     // Usage\n     srv := NewServer(\":8080\", WithTimeout(60*time.Second))\n     ```\n\n6. **Avoid named return values except for docs/short functions**\n   - Never use naked returns in long functions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Short function\n     func Split(path string) (dir, file string) {\n         i := strings.LastIndex(path, \"/\")\n         return path[:i], path[i+1:]\n     }\n\n     // BAD: Long function with naked return\n     func ProcessData(input []byte) (result []byte, err error) {\n         // ... 50 lines ...\n         return  // Unclear what's returned\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Group 4+ related parameters into a struct**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func CreateUser(name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip string) (*User, error)\n\n     // GOOD\n     type CreateUserRequest struct {\n         Name    string\n         Email   string\n         Phone   string\n         Address Address\n     }\n     func CreateUser(req CreateUserRequest) (*User, error)\n     ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. **Always check errors - Never ignore them**\n   - Use `_` only when you're certain there's no error\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     data, _ := os.ReadFile(\"config.json\")\n     json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg)\n\n     // GOOD\n     data, err := os.ReadFile(\"config.json\")\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"read config: %w\", err)\n     }\n     if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"parse config: %w\", err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Wrap errors with context using `%w`**\n   - Preserves error chain for `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`\n   - Add context about what operation failed\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err  // Lost context\n     }\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"failed: %v\", err)  // Breaks error chain\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"fetch user %s: %w\", userID, err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `errors.Is()` for sentinel errors, `errors.As()` for error types**\n   - Don't compare error strings\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err.Error() == \"not found\" { }\n     if err == io.EOF { }  // Fails if error is wrapped\n\n     // GOOD\n     if errors.Is(err, io.EOF) { }\n     if errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound) { }\n\n     var validationErr *ValidationError\n     if errors.As(err, &validationErr) {\n         // Handle validation error\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Define sentinel errors at package level, custom types when needed**\n   - Sentinel errors: simple cases with no additional data\n   - Custom types: when you need to attach context\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Sentinel errors\n     var (\n         ErrNotFound     = errors.New(\"not found\")\n         ErrUnauthorized = errors.New(\"unauthorized\")\n     )\n\n     // Custom error type with context\n     type ValidationError struct {\n         Field   string\n         Message string\n     }\n\n     func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {\n         return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s: %s\", e.Field, e.Message)\n     }\n\n     // Usage\n     if user.Email == \"\" {\n         return &ValidationError{Field: \"email\", Message: \"required\"}\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Handle errors at the appropriate level**\n   - Log at the top level (main, handlers)\n   - Add context at each level\n   - Don't log-and-return (causes duplicate logs)\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Logs at every level\n     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n         user, err := db.Query(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             log.Printf(\"database error: %v\", err)  // Don't log here\n             return nil, err\n         }\n         return user, nil\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Add context, log at top level\n     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n         user, err := db.Query(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"query user %s: %w\", id, err)\n         }\n         return user, nil\n     }\n\n     func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n         user, err := fetchUser(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             log.Printf(\"fetch user failed: %v\", err)  // Log here\n             http.Error(w, \"internal error\", 500)\n             return\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Return early on errors - don't use else blocks**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err\n     } else {\n         // continue processing\n         result := process(data)\n         return nil\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err\n     }\n     result := process(data)\n     return nil\n     ```\n\n7. **Use defer for cleanup, even on error paths**\n   - Ensures resources are released\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func processFile(path string) error {\n         f, err := os.Open(path)\n         if err != nil {\n             return err\n         }\n         defer f.Close()  // Always closes, even on error\n\n         // Process file...\n         if err := process(f); err != nil {\n             return err  // File still closes\n         }\n         return nil\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Interfaces & Types\n\n1. **Keep interfaces small - prefer single-method interfaces**\n   - Easier to implement and test\n   - More composable and flexible\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Small, focused interfaces\n     type Reader interface {\n         Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n     }\n\n     type Writer interface {\n         Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n     }\n\n     type ReadWriter interface {\n         Reader\n         Writer\n     }\n\n     // BAD: Large interface\n     type Storage interface {\n         Read(key string) ([]byte, error)\n         Write(key string, data []byte) error\n         Delete(key string) error\n         List() ([]string, error)\n         Close() error\n         Ping() error\n         Stats() (Statistics, error)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Define interfaces in consumer packages, not producer packages**\n   - Define interfaces where they're used, not where they're implemented\n   - Keeps packages decoupled\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: storage package defines interface\n     package storage\n     type Storage interface {\n         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     }\n     type PostgresStorage struct{}\n     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n\n     // GOOD: consumer defines interface\n     package handler\n     type storage interface {  // lowercase, internal\n         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     }\n     type Handler struct {\n         storage storage\n     }\n\n     package storage\n     type PostgresStorage struct{}  // Just implements it\n     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     ```\n\n3. **Use composition over inheritance**\n   - Embed types to reuse behavior\n   - Promotes flexibility and clear relationships\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Composition via embedding\n     type Logger struct {\n         writer io.Writer\n     }\n\n     type HTTPLogger struct {\n         Logger  // Embeds Logger\n         prefix string\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Explicit composition\n     type Service struct {\n         storage Storage\n         cache   Cache\n         logger  Logger\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Order struct fields: groups by purpose, consider alignment**\n   - Group related fields together\n   - Consider memory alignment for hot-path structs\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Grouped by purpose\n     type Server struct {\n         // Connection settings\n         addr string\n         port int\n\n         // Timeouts\n         readTimeout  time.Duration\n         writeTimeout time.Duration\n\n         // Dependencies\n         storage Storage\n         logger  Logger\n\n         // Internal state\n         mu      sync.Mutex\n         running bool\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Optimized for alignment (hot path)\n     type Event struct {\n         timestamp int64   // 8 bytes\n         userID    int64   // 8 bytes\n         eventType int32   // 4 bytes\n         flags     int32   // 4 bytes\n         name      string  // 16 bytes\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Use pointers for large structs or when mutability is needed**\n   - Small structs (< 100 bytes): can use values\n   - Large structs: use pointers to avoid copies\n   - Mutable structs: use pointers\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Small, immutable: use values\n     type Point struct {\n         X, Y int\n     }\n     func Translate(p Point, dx, dy int) Point\n\n     // Large or mutable: use pointers\n     type User struct {\n         ID       string\n         Email    string\n         Profile  Profile\n         Settings Settings\n         // ... many fields\n     }\n     func UpdateUser(u *User) error\n\n     type Counter struct {\n         count int\n     }\n     func (c *Counter) Increment()\n     ```\n\n6. **Use struct tags for metadata, keep them consistent**\n   - Common tags: `json`, `yaml`, `db`, `validate`\n   - Be consistent with naming conventions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type User struct {\n         ID        string    `json:\"id\" db:\"user_id\"`\n         Email     string    `json:\"email\" db:\"email\" validate:\"required,email\"`\n         CreatedAt time.Time `json:\"created_at\" db:\"created_at\"`\n         UpdatedAt time.Time `json:\"updated_at\" db:\"updated_at\"`\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Don't export unnecessary fields - prefer getter methods when needed**\n   - Unexported fields allow you to change internal representation\n   - Exported fields become part of your API\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Exposes internal state\n     type Cache struct {\n         Data map[string]interface{}\n         Mu   sync.RWMutex\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Encapsulates internals\n     type Cache struct {\n         data map[string]interface{}\n         mu   sync.RWMutex\n     }\n\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {\n         c.mu.RLock()\n         defer c.mu.RUnlock()\n         val, ok := c.data[key]\n         return val, ok\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Comments & Documentation\n\n1. **All exported identifiers must have doc comments**\n   - Start with the identifier name\n   - Use complete sentences\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     // User represents a user account in the system.\n     type User struct {\n         ID    string\n         Email string\n     }\n\n     // NewUser creates a new user with the given email.\n     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n         return &User{Email: email}\n     }\n\n     // BAD\n     // user struct\n     type User struct{}\n\n     // creates a user\n     func NewUser(email string) *User\n     ```\n\n2. **Package comment should describe the package purpose**\n   - Place in `doc.go` or at the top of any file in the package\n   - Start with \"Package <name>\"\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers for the user API.\n     //\n     // The handlers support JSON request/response formats and include\n     // built-in validation and error handling.\n     package handler\n     ```\n\n4. **Use TODO comments with issue references**\n   - Format: `// TODO(#issue): description`\n   - Always link to an issue or ticket\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     // TODO(#123): Add support for pagination\n     // TODO(alice): Optimize this query for large datasets\n\n     // BAD\n     // TODO: fix this later\n     // FIXME\n     ```\n\n5. **Use examples in doc comments for complex APIs**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // ProcessBatch processes multiple items in parallel.\n     //\n     // Example:\n     //\n     //     items := []Item{{ID: \"1\"}, {ID: \"2\"}}\n     //     results, err := ProcessBatch(ctx, items, 10)\n     //     if err != nil {\n     //         log.Fatal(err)\n     //     }\n     //\n     func ProcessBatch(ctx context.Context, items []Item, workers int) ([]Result, error)\n     ```\n","numLines":900,"startLine":1,"totalLines":900}}}

Decode into Go type\nvar state project.ProjectState\nunified.Decode(&state)\n```\n\n## Notes on Optional Fields\n\nOptional fields in CUE (marked with `?`) are represented in Go with `omitempty` tags:\n\n```go\n// CUE definition\nstarted_at?: time.Time\n\n// Generated Go type\nStarted_at time.Time `json:\"started_at,omitempty\"`\n```\n\nZero values are omitted during JSON marshaling. Use time.IsZero() to check if optional timestamps were set.\n\n## Schema Constraints\n\n### Universal Project Schemas\n\nThe project schemas enforce:\n- **Project names**: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$` (kebab-case, no leading/trailing hyphens)\n- **Project types**: `^[a-z0-9_]+$` (lowercase alphanumeric with underscores)\n- **Task IDs**: `^[0-9]{3}$` (exactly 3 digits: 001, 010, 042, 999)\n- **Task status**: `\"pending\" | \"in_progress\" | \"completed\" | \"abandoned\"`\n- **Phase status**: Defined by project type (e.g., \"pending\", \"in_progress\", \"completed\")\n- **Non-empty strings**: All required text fields must be non-empty\n- **Iteration numbers**: Must be >= 1\n- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 via `time.Time`\n\n### Refs Schemas\n\nThe refs schemas enforce:\n- **Semantic versioning**: `^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+$`\n- **SHA hashes**: `^[a-f0-9]{40}$`\n- **File protocol**: `^file:///.+` for local refs\n\n## Testing\n\nRun tests to verify schemas and generated types:\n\n```bash\n# Test universal project schemas (53 tests)\ngo test ./schemas/project\n\n# Test all schemas\ngo test ./schemas/...\n```\n\nThe project schema tests verify:\n- Valid state creation and modification\n- Constraint enforcement (patterns, enums, required fields)\n- Optional field handling\n- Nested structure validation (phases, tasks, artifacts)\n\n## Universal Data Model\n\nThe `project/` schemas define a **universal data model** that all project types share:\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Single Type System**: All project types (standard, exploration, design, etc.) use the same `ProjectState`, `PhaseState`, `TaskState`, and `ArtifactState` types.\n\n2. **Flexible Metadata**: Common fields (status, timestamps, collections) are strongly typed.

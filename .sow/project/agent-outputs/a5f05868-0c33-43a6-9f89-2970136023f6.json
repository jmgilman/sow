Your sole purpose is to implement what is specified—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n## Immediate Actions\n\nFollow these steps in order:\n\n### 1. Read Task State\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/state.yaml`\n\nOr use command: `sow task status --id {id}`\n\nCheck:\n- **iteration**: What iteration are you on? (1 = first attempt, 2+ = addressing feedback)\n- **assigned_agent**: Confirm you're the right agent\n- **inputs**: Context files and feedback the orchestrator wants you to review\n  - Look for inputs with `type: reference` (context files)\n  - Look for inputs with `type: feedback` (review feedback from previous iterations)\n\n### 2. Read Requirements\n\nRead: `.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/description.md`\n\nUnderstand:\n- What needs to be done\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Any specific constraints or requirements\n- Task scenario type (see detection heuristics below)\n\n**CRITICAL: Validate Task Description Sufficiency**\n\nBefore proceeding, verify the description includes:\n- Context about the overall goal\n- Detailed requirements (NOT just 1-2 sentences)\n- Clear acceptance criteria\n- Technical details (APIs, patterns, file locations)\n- Examples or code snippets (when relevant)\n\n**If the description is insufficient** (e.g., \"Add JWT middleware\" with no details):\n\n1. Log the issue:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: insufficient task description\" -r \"Task description lacks technical details and acceptance criteria needed for implementation\"\n   ```\n\n2. Report back to orchestrator with specifics about what's missing:\n   \"I cannot proceed with this task. The description '{task_name}' is too brief. I need:\n   - Context: What am I building this for?\n   - Requirements: Detailed specifications (algorithm, data structures, etc.)\n   - Acceptance Criteria: How do I know when it's done correctly?\n   - Technical Details: File locations, APIs to use, patterns to follow\n   - Examples: Expected inputs/outputs, code snippets, test cases\"\n\n3. DO NOT attempt to implement based on guesswork\n4. DO NOT proceed without comprehensive requirements\n\nThe orchestrator must provide complete task descriptions. You start with zero context.\n\n### 3. Read Feedback (If Iteration > 1)\n\nIf iteration > 1, check task inputs for feedback artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: feedback`. The most recent feedback will be at:\n`.sow/project/phases/implementation/tasks/{id}/feedback/{iteration-1}.md`\n\nFor example:\n- Iteration 2: Read `feedback/1.md`\n- Iteration 3: Read `feedback/2.md`\n\nEach feedback file contains corrections from the orchestrator. Check the input's metadata for assessment:\n- `metadata.assessment: fail` means you must address the feedback\n- `metadata.assessment: pass` means work was approved (you shouldn't be here)\n\nAddress ALL feedback items before proceeding.\n\n### 4. Load Mandatory TDD Guidance\n\n**ALWAYS run this command:**\n\n```bash\nsow prompt guidance/implementer/tdd\n```\n\nTDD is non-negotiable. You write tests first, always.\n\n### 5. Infer Scenario and Load Appropriate Guidance\n\nRead the description.md content and detect which scenario applies:\n\n**Scenario Detection Heuristics:**\n\n**FEATURE** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"implement\", \"add\", \"create\", \"build\", \"new\", \"develop\", \"write\"\n- OR: Describes new functionality that doesn't exist yet\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/feature`\n\n**BUG** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"fix\", \"bug\", \"issue\", \"broken\", \"not working\", \"error\", \"crash\", \"fails\", \"incorrect\", \"wrong\"\n- OR: References an existing feature that isn't working correctly\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/bug`\n\n**REFACTOR** - If description contains keywords:\n- \"refactor\", \"improve\", \"restructure\", \"clean up\", \"optimize\", \"simplify\", \"reorganize\"\n- OR: Explicitly states behavior should NOT change\n\n→ Load: `sow prompt guidance/implementer/refactor`\n\n**If ambiguous or unclear:** Default to feature workflow.\n\n### 6. Review Referenced Files\n\nCheck task inputs for reference artifacts:\n\nUse: `sow task status --id {id}` to see all inputs\n\nLook for inputs with `type: reference`. Read each referenced file:\n- Architecture docs in `.sow/knowledge/`\n- Style guides or conventions in `.sow/sinks/`\n- Example code in `.sow/repos/`\n- Project-specific context documents\n\nThese provide context the orchestrator wants you to consider.\n\n### 7. Execute Implementation\n\nFollow the workflow defined in the scenario prompt you loaded (feature/bug/refactor).\n\nAll workflows share these principles:\n- **Test first, always**\n- **Implement only what is specified**\n- **Mock external dependencies**\n- **Log your actions**\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Test First, Always\n\nWrite tests before implementation code. No exceptions.\n\nTests define the behavior you must implement. If you can't write a test first, stop and escalate the issue.\n\n### Implement Only What Is Specified\n\nYou do not design. You do not modify requirements. You do not add \"nice to have\" features.\n\nRead description.md and implement exactly what it describes—nothing more, nothing less.\n\n### Your Boundaries\n\n**YOU DO:**\n- Write tests first (TDD)\n- Implement code to make tests pass\n- Refactor for quality without changing behavior\n- Mock external dependencies via ports/interfaces\n- Log all actions to task log.md\n- Work only within your assigned task scope\n- Track modified files using `sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path <path>`\n- Track context used using `sow task input add --id {id} --type reference --path <path>`\n\n**YOU DO NOT:**\n- Change architecture or design decisions\n- Work on tasks other than your assigned task\n- Modify requirements or acceptance criteria\n- Skip writing tests for any reason\n- Use real databases, APIs, or external systems in unit tests\n- Modify files owned by orchestrator (`.sow/project/state.yaml`, project-level log.md)\n- Modify other tasks' files\n\n## Task Completion\n\nWhen implementation is complete:\n\n1. **Run all tests** - Ensure everything passes\n\n2. **Track modified files:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/modified/file.go\"\n   sow task output add --id {id} --type modified --path \"path/to/test/file_test.go\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Log final summary** to task log.md\n\n4. **Mark task for review:**\n   ```bash\n   sow task set --id {id} status needs_review\n   ```\n\n5. **Return control to orchestrator** - Your work is done\n\nThe orchestrator will review your changes and either:\n- **Approve**: Sets `status = completed` (task done)\n- **Request changes**: Adds feedback as input, sets `status = in_progress`, increments `iteration` (you'll be restarted)\n\n## Logging Your Work\n\nLog significant actions to help the orchestrator understand what you did:\n\n```bash\nsow agent log -a \"Wrote tests for JWT validation\" -r \"Created 5 test cases covering valid/invalid tokens\" -f middleware/jwt_test.go\nsow agent log -a \"Implemented JWT middleware\" -r \"Validates tokens and sets user context\" -f middleware/jwt.go\nsow agent log -a \"Refactored error handling\" -r \"Consolidated error types into pkg/errors\" -f pkg/errors/errors.go -f middleware/jwt.go\n```\n\nLogs help with:\n- Debugging if something goes wrong\n- Understanding your reasoning during review\n- Resumability if the task needs to be re-run\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop immediately and report to the orchestrator if:\n\n**Design Issues:**\n- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory\n- Cannot write unit tests in isolation (missing interfaces to mock)\n- Implementation requires architectural changes\n- Existing code structure prevents proper testing\n\n**Blockers:**\n- Missing dependencies or unclear context\n- Conflicting feedback from multiple iterations\n- Task depends on another task that isn't complete\n\n**How to Escalate:**\n\n1. Log the blocker clearly:\n   ```bash\n   sow agent log -a \"Blocked: missing database interface\" -r \"Cannot mock database calls - no repository interface exists\"\n   ```\n\n2. Mark task appropriately (usually keep as in_progress)\n\n3. Report the blocker to the orchestrator in your response\n\nDo not attempt to fix architectural problems yourself. That is the architect's responsibility.\n\n## Implementation Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- **Writing code before tests** - Always test first\n- **Over-engineering** - Don't add functionality beyond requirements (YAGNI)\n- **Working outside scope** - Don't \"fix\" other issues you notice\n- **Tight coupling** - Respect architectural boundaries\n- **Ignoring feedback** - Address ALL feedback items in subsequent iterations\n- **Silent failures** - If blocked, escalate immediately\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou now have your base instructions. Proceed with steps 1-7 above to begin implementation.\n\nRemember: Load TDD guidance first (mandatory), then load the appropriate scenario guidance based on your task description.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a5f05868-0c33-43a6-9f89-2970136023f6","uuid":"78da4883-19cb-4853-9819-deef2847995e","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Implementer Agent - Base Instructions\n\nYou are a software implementer.

The overall goal is to move Git/GitHub code from `cli/internal/sow/` to `libs/git/`, creating a standalone Go module with clean interfaces (ports) and implementations (adapters), decoupled from `sow.Context`.\n\nThis is the foundational task that creates the module structure, defines shared types, and establishes error handling patterns. Subsequent tasks will build on this foundation.\n\n**Critical Design Principle**: The new module must NOT depend on `sow.Context`. Functions accept explicit parameters (repo root paths, executors) instead of a Context object.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Create Module Structure\n\nCreate the following directory structure:\n```\nlibs/git/\n├── go.mod                # Module definition\n├── go.sum                # Dependencies (after go mod tidy)\n├── doc.go                # Package documentation\n├── types.go              # Issue, LinkedBranch, Label types\n├── errors.go             # Error type definitions\n└── mocks/\n    └── .gitkeep          # Placeholder (mocks generated in later task)\n```\n\n### 2. Create go.mod\n\nModule path: `github.com/jmgilman/sow/libs/git`\n\nDependencies to include:\n- `github.com/jmgilman/sow/libs/exec` - For command execution abstraction\n\nUse Go version 1.25.3 (matching libs/exec).\n\n### 3. Create doc.go\n\nPackage documentation following the pattern from `libs/exec/doc.go`:\n- Explain the package purpose: Git and GitHub operations for sow\n- Document the ports and adapters design pattern\n- Provide usage examples for Git operations and GitHubClient\n- Reference the mocks subpackage for testing\n- Use complete godoc formatting\n\n### 4. Create types.go\n\nMove and adapt these types from `cli/internal/sow/github_cli.go`:\n\n```go\n// Issue represents a GitHub issue.\ntype Issue struct {\n    Number int    `json:\"number\"`\n    Title  string `json:\"title\"`\n    Body   string `json:\"body\"`\n    State  string `json:\"state\"`\n    URL    string `json:\"url\"`\n    Labels []Label `json:\"labels\"`\n}\n\n// Label represents a GitHub label.\ntype Label struct {\n    Name string `json:\"name\"`\n}\n\n// HasLabel checks if an issue has a specific label.\nfunc (i *Issue) HasLabel(label string) bool\n\n// LinkedBranch represents a branch linked to an issue.\ntype LinkedBranch struct {\n    Name string\n    URL  string\n}\n```\n\nNote: The Labels field is changed from inline `[]struct{ Name string }` to a proper named type `[]Label` for better usability.\n\n### 5. Create errors.go\n\nDefine error types following the pattern from the existing code:\n\n```go\n// ErrGHNotInstalled is returned when the gh CLI is not found in PATH.\ntype ErrGHNotInstalled struct{}\nfunc (e ErrGHNotInstalled) Error() string\n\n// ErrGHNotAuthenticated is returned when gh CLI is installed but not authenticated.\ntype ErrGHNotAuthenticated struct{}\nfunc (e ErrGHNotAuthenticated) Error() string\n\n// ErrGHCommand is returned when a gh command fails.\ntype ErrGHCommand struct {\n    Command string\n    Stderr  string\n    Err     error\n}\nfunc (e ErrGHCommand) Error() string\nfunc (e ErrGHCommand) Unwrap() error\n\n// ErrNotGitRepository is returned when the path is not a git repository.\ntype ErrNotGitRepository struct {\n    Path string\n}\nfunc (e ErrNotGitRepository) Error() string\n\n// ErrBranchExists is returned when attempting to create a branch that already exists.\ntype ErrBranchExists struct {\n    Branch string\n}\nfunc (e ErrBranchExists) Error() string\n```\n\nError messages should be clear and actionable.

TDD is non-negotiable.\n\n## Core TDD Principles\n\n### 1. Test First, Always\n\nWrite tests before writing implementation code. Tests define the behavior you must implement. No exceptions.\n\n**The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**\n\n1. **Red**: Write a failing test\n2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make it pass\n3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality without changing behavior\n4. Repeat\n\n### 2. Test Behavior, Not Implementation\n\nTests verify **what code does**, not **how it does it**.\n\nTest outcomes and public APIs. Internal implementation details are irrelevant to tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests internal calls (implementation detail)\ndef test_calls_internal_method():\n    service.process()\n    assert service._internal_method.called\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Tests outcome (observable behavior)\ndef test_process_returns_correct_result():\n    result = service.process()\n    assert result.value == expected_value\n```\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Implementation tests break when you refactor (even if behavior is unchanged)\n- Behavior tests survive refactoring\n- You want freedom to improve code without breaking tests\n\n### 3. Unit Tests Stay Isolated\n\nUnit tests never touch external systems—no databases, APIs, file systems, or network calls.\n\n**Mock all outbound dependencies** using interfaces/ports.\n\n**If you cannot isolate a test, stop and raise the issue.** This indicates a design problem.\n\n## Mocking External Dependencies\n\nHexagonal architecture provides **ports** (interfaces) for external systems. Mock the ports, never concrete adapters.\n\n```python\n# ✅ CORRECT: Mock the port interface\nmock_repo = Mock(UserRepository)  # Repository is an interface/port\nmock_repo.find_by_id.return_value = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\nservice = UserService(mock_repo)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")\nassert result.name == \"Alice\"\n\n# ❌ WRONG: Use real adapter\nreal_db = PostgresUserRepository(connection_string)  # External dependency!\nservice = UserService(real_db)\nresult = service.get_user(\"123\")  # This hits the real database\n```\n\n**If you cannot mock a dependency, the design is wrong.** Stop immediately and raise the issue to the orchestrator.\n\n### Why Mock?\n\n- **Speed**: Unit tests run in milliseconds\n- **Reliability**: No flaky tests due to network/database issues\n- **Isolation**: Test one unit at a time\n- **Independence**: Tests don't depend on external system state\n\n## Writing Effective Tests\n\n### Test One Behavior Per Test\n\nEach test should verify a single behavior. Multiple behaviors require multiple tests.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Tests multiple behaviors\ndef test_user_service():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n    deleted = service.delete_user(user.id)\n    assert deleted is True\n\n# ✅ GOOD: One behavior per test\ndef test_create_user_returns_user_with_correct_name():\n    user = service.create_user(\"Alice\")\n    assert user.name == \"Alice\"\n\ndef test_update_user_changes_name():\n    user = User(id=\"123\", name=\"Alice\")\n    updated = service.update_user(user.id, \"Bob\")\n    assert updated.name == \"Bob\"\n\ndef test_delete_user_returns_true_on_success():\n    deleted = service.delete_user(\"123\")\n    assert deleted is True\n```\n\n### Use Loose Assertions\n\nAvoid brittle tests by using partial matches instead of exact matches.\n\n```python\n# ❌ FRAGILE: Exact string match\nassert message == \"User premium-123 received 10% discount on item ABC\"\n# Breaks if: wording changes, user ID format changes, item name changes\n\n# ✅ ROBUST: Partial matches\nassert \"premium\" in message.lower()\nassert \"discount\" in message\n# Survives: wording changes, formatting changes\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ FRAGILE: Exact structure match\nexpect(result).toEqual({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  email: \"alice@example.com\",\n  created_at: \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  metadata: { ... }\n});\n\n// ✅ ROBUST: Match what matters\nexpect(result).toMatchObject({\n  id: 123,\n  name: \"Alice\"\n});\nexpect(result.email).toContain(\"@example.com\");\n```\n\n### Avoid Testing Private Methods Directly\n\nPrivate methods are implementation details. Test them indirectly through public APIs.\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Testing private method directly\ndef test_calculate_discount_internal():\n    result = service._calculate_discount(100, \"PREMIUM\")\n    assert result == 10\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Test private method through public API\ndef test_premium_users_receive_discount():\n    order = service.process_order(user_type=\"PREMIUM\", amount=100)\n    assert order.total == 90  # 10% discount applied\n```\n\n**Why:** If you refactor and rename/remove `_calculate_discount`, the public behavior test still passes. The private method test breaks.\n\n### Test Edge Cases and Boundaries\n\nDon't just test the happy path. Test:\n\n- **Null/empty inputs**: What happens with `None`, `\"\"`, `[]`?\n- **Boundary values**: Minimum, maximum, just inside/outside limits\n- **Error conditions**: Invalid input, missing data, permissions denied\n- **Edge cases**: Zero, negative numbers, special characters\n\n```python\n# Don't just test:\ndef test_divide_returns_correct_result():\n    assert divide(10, 2) == 5\n\n# Also test:\ndef test_divide_by_zero_raises_error():\n    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n        divide(10, 0)\n\ndef test_divide_with_negative_numbers():\n    assert divide(-10, 2) == -5\n    assert divide(10, -2) == -5\n```\n\n## Test Coverage Goals\n\n### Aim for >90% Behavioral Coverage\n\nPrioritize **behavioral coverage** over **code coverage**.\n\n**Behavioral coverage**: Every requirement in description.md has a test. Every edge case has a test.\n\n**Code coverage**: Percentage of lines executed by tests (this is secondary).\n\n### What to Test\n\n**Always test:**\n- Every requirement from description.md\n- All error handling paths\n- Boundary conditions\n- Edge cases\n\n**Don't obsess over:**\n- Trivial getters/setters (if they literally just return a field)\n- Auto-generated code\n- Framework code you don't own\n\n## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n**❌ Testing private methods directly**\n- Test behavior through public API instead\n\n**❌ Asserting on internal state instead of behavior**\n- Check what the system does, not how it stores data internally\n\n**❌ Using exact string/structure matches**\n- Use partial matches for robustness\n\n**❌ Writing tests after implementation**\n- Test first, always\n\n**❌ Skipping tests for \"simple\" code**\n- Simple code can still have bugs; test it\n\n**❌ Mocking concrete classes instead of interfaces**\n- Mock ports/interfaces, not adapters\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on execution order**\n- Each test should be independent\n\n**❌ Tests that depend on external system state**\n- Mock all external dependencies\n\n**❌ One giant test that tests everything**\n- One test per behavior\n\n## Integration with Hexagonal Architecture\n\nYour codebase likely follows **hexagonal architecture** (ports and adapters pattern).\n\n**Ports**: Interfaces defining contracts with external systems (database, API, file system)\n**Adapters**: Concrete implementations of ports\n\n**In unit tests, mock the ports:**\n\n```typescript\n// Port (interface)\ninterface UserRepository {\n  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;\n  save(user: User): Promise<void>;\n}\n\n// Service depends on port\nclass UserService {\n  constructor(private repo: UserRepository) {}\n\n  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n    const user = await this.repo.findById(id);\n    if (!user) throw new Error(\"User not found\");\n    return user;\n  }\n}\n\n// Test mocks the port\ntest(\"getUser returns user when found\", async () => {\n  const mockRepo: UserRepository = {\n    findById: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: \"123\", name: \"Alice\" }),\n    save: jest.fn()\n  };\n\n  const service = new UserService(mockRepo);\n  const user = await service.getUser(\"123\");\n\n  expect(user.name).toBe(\"Alice\");\n});\n```\n\n**Never mock concrete adapters in unit tests:**\n```typescript\n// ❌ BAD: Using real adapter in unit test\nconst realAdapter = new PostgresUserRepository(config);\nconst service = new UserService(realAdapter);\n// This is now an integration test, not a unit test\n```\n\n## When Testing Reveals Design Issues\n\nIf you cannot write isolated unit tests, this reveals a design problem:\n\n**Problem**: Cannot mock a dependency\n**Cause**: No interface/port exists for the external system\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate to orchestrator (this is an architectural fix)\n\n**Problem**: Test setup is extremely complicated\n**Cause**: Too many dependencies, tight coupling\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (design needs simplification)\n\n**Problem**: Cannot test without real database/API\n**Cause**: Business logic is embedded in adapter layer\n**Solution**: Stop and escalate (logic should be in domain/service layer)\n\nDo not attempt to fix these architectural problems yourself. Raise the issue and wait for guidance.\n\n## TDD Workflow Summary\n\nFor every feature/bug/refactor:\n\n1. **Understand the requirement** - What behavior needs to exist?\n2. **Write a failing test** - Describe the behavior in code\n3. **Run the test** - Confirm it fails (red)\n4. **Write minimal implementation** - Just enough to pass\n5. **Run the test** - Confirm it passes (green)\n6. **Refactor** - Improve code quality\n7. **Run the test** - Confirm it still passes\n8. **Repeat** - Until all requirements are met\n\nTest first, always.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a5f05868-0c33-43a6-9f89-2970136023f6","uuid":"9447a606-a9f7-4fc5-86a0-64dbdfdae9f0","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology\n\nThis guidance is **mandatory** for all implementer work.

Token parsing from Authorization header\n2. Token signature validation\n3. Token expiration checking\n4. User context extraction from token\n5. Request rejection on invalid token\n6. Request continuation on valid token\n\nEach unit becomes a test (or set of tests).\n\n### Phase 3: Identify Integration Points\n\nDetermine where your feature integrates with existing code:\n\n- **Inbound**: How does the feature get invoked?

(database, API, cache)\n- **Data structures**: What domain models does it use or create?\n\n**Important**: For outbound dependencies, verify that **ports (interfaces) exist** for mocking. If not, stop and escalate.\n\n### Phase 4: Test-First Implementation\n\nFor each testable unit:\n\n1. **Write the test first**\n   - Describe the behavior you want\n   - Use mocks for all external dependencies\n   - Test one behavior per test\n\n2. **Watch it fail**\n   - Run the test, confirm it fails (red)\n   - If it passes without implementation, your test is wrong\n\n3. **Write minimal implementation**\n   - Just enough code to make the test pass\n   - Don't over-engineer or add extra features\n\n4. **Watch it pass**\n   - Run the test, confirm it passes (green)\n\n5. **Refactor if needed**\n   - Improve code quality without changing behavior\n   - Run tests again to ensure they still pass\n\n6. **Repeat** for the next unit\n\n### Phase 5: Integration Verification\n\nAfter implementing all units:\n\n1. **Run the full test suite** - Ensure you didn't break existing functionality\n2. **Verify your feature works end-to-end** (if possible in your test environment)\n3. **Check code coverage** - Aim for >90% of your new code\n\n## Feature-Specific Guidance\n\n### Creating New Files vs Modifying Existing\n\n**Create new files when:**\n- Adding a new domain concept or service\n- Implementing a new layer (new adapter, new port)\n- Tests for new code\n\n**Modify existing files when:**\n- Extending existing functionality\n- Adding to an existing service or handler\n- Integrating with existing code\n\n**Rule of thumb**: Follow the existing code organization patterns. If authentication code lives in `pkg/auth/`, your new auth feature should too.\n\n### Working with Existing Code\n\nYour feature likely integrates with existing code:\n\n1. **Read the existing code** - Understand how it works\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style and structure\n3. **Respect abstractions** - Use ports/interfaces, don't bypass them\n4. **Don't refactor while implementing** - That's a separate task\n\nIf existing code is problematic (no testability, tight coupling), stop and escalate. Don't fix architecture issues during feature implementation.\n\n### Incremental Implementation Approach\n\nBuild features incrementally, not all at once:\n\n**✅ Good (incremental):**\n1. Implement token parsing → test → commit\n2. Implement signature validation → test → commit\n3. Implement expiration checking → test → commit\n4. (Continue for each unit)\n\n**❌ Bad (big bang):**\n1. Write all the code for the entire feature\n2. Try to make all tests pass at once\n3. Spend hours debugging\n\nIncremental commits give you:\n- Easier debugging (smaller change sets)\n- Clearer progress\n- Ability to roll back partially if needed\n\n### Documentation\n\nFor new features, update documentation:\n\n1. **Code comments** - Explain non-obvious decisions\n2. **README** - If feature affects usage, update README\n3. **API docs** - If adding public APIs, document them\n\nDon't write extensive design docs (that's the architect's job). Just document **usage** and **non-obvious implementation choices**.\n\n## Common Feature Implementation Pitfalls\n\n**❌ Over-engineering**: Adding flexibility beyond requirements\n- Build what's specified, not what might be needed later (YAGNI)\n\n**❌ Skipping tests**: \"I'll add tests later\"\n- Tests never get added, or you discover your code isn't testable\n\n**❌ Big changes without testing**: Implementing entire feature before running tests\n- When tests fail, you have no idea what's wrong\n\n**❌ Modifying requirements**: \"I think it should work this way instead\"\n- Implement what's specified; propose changes separately\n\n**❌ Refactoring existing code as part of feature work**\n- Mixing refactoring with new features makes review difficult\n\n## Feature Completion Checklist\n\nBefore marking the task as needs_review:\n\n- [ ] All requirements from description.md are implemented\n- [ ] All new code has tests\n- [ ] All tests pass (including existing tests)\n- [ ] Code coverage >90% for new code\n- [ ] No real database/API calls in unit tests (all mocked)\n- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions\n- [ ] Modified files tracked: `sow agent task state add-file <path>`\n- [ ] Actions logged to task log.md\n- [ ] No \"TODO\" or \"FIXME\" comments left in code\n\n## Example: JWT Middleware Implementation\n\n**Requirement**: \"Implement JWT authentication middleware that validates tokens and sets user context\"\n\n**Test-first approach:**\n\n```typescript\n// Test 1: Parsing\ntest(\"extracts token from Authorization header\", () => {\n  const req = { headers: { authorization: \"Bearer abc123\" } };\n  const token = extractToken(req);\n  expect(token).toBe(\"abc123\");\n});\n\n// Implementation 1: Just enough to pass\nfunction extractToken(req): string {\n  const auth = req.headers.authorization;\n  return auth.split(\" \")[1];\n}\n\n// Test 2: Validation\ntest(\"validates token signature\", async () => {\n  const mockVerifier = { verify: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true) };\n  const result = await validateToken(\"valid-token\", mockVerifier);\n  expect(result).toBe(true);\n});\n\n// Implementation 2: Just enough to pass\nasync function validateToken(token, verifier): Promise<boolean> {\n  return await verifier.verify(token);\n}\n\n// Continue for all units...\n```\n\nNotice:\n- Each test is small and focused\n- Implementation is minimal\n- External dependencies (token verifier) are mocked\n- Tests define behavior before implementation exists\n\n## When to Stop and Escalate\n\nStop if:\n- Requirements are ambiguous (which scenarios should be handled?)\n- No interface exists for external dependency (can't mock)\n- Existing code structure prevents proper integration\n- Feature requires architectural changes\n\nDon't guess or make assumptions.

Sentinel errors: simple cases with no additional data\n   549→   - Custom types: when you need to attach context\n   550→   - Example:\n   551→     ```go\n   552→     // Sentinel errors\n   553→     var (\n   554→         ErrNotFound     = errors.New(\"not found\")\n   555→         ErrUnauthorized = errors.New(\"unauthorized\")\n   556→     )\n   557→\n   558→     // Custom error type with context\n   559→     type ValidationError struct {\n   560→         Field   string\n   561→         Message string\n   562→     }\n   563→\n   564→     func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {\n   565→         return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s: %s\", e.Field, e.Message)\n   566→     }\n   567→\n   568→     // Usage\n   569→     if user.Email == \"\" {\n   570→         return &ValidationError{Field: \"email\", Message: \"required\"}\n   571→     }\n   572→     ```\n   573→\n   574→5. **Handle errors at the appropriate level**\n   575→   - Log at the top level (main, handlers)\n   576→   - Add context at each level\n   577→   - Don't log-and-return (causes duplicate logs)\n   578→   - Example:\n   579→     ```go\n   580→     // BAD: Logs at every level\n   581→     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n   582→         user, err := db.Query(id)\n   583→         if err != nil {\n   584→             log.Printf(\"database error: %v\", err)  // Don't log here\n   585→             return nil, err\n   586→         }\n   587→         return user, nil\n   588→     }\n   589→\n   590→     // GOOD: Add context, log at top level\n   591→     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n   592→         user, err := db.Query(id)\n   593→         if err != nil {\n   594→             return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"query user %s: %w\", id, err)\n   595→         }\n   596→         return user, nil\n   597→     }\n   598→\n   599→     func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n   600→         user, err := fetchUser(id)\n   601→         if err != nil {\n   602→             log.Printf(\"fetch user failed: %v\", err)  // Log here\n   603→             http.Error(w, \"internal error\", 500)\n   604→             return\n   605→         }\n   606→     }\n   607→     ```\n   608→\n   609→6. **Return early on errors -

prefer single-method interfaces**\n   652→   - Easier to implement and test\n   653→   - More composable and flexible\n   654→   - Example:\n   655→     ```go\n   656→     // GOOD: Small, focused interfaces\n   657→     type Reader interface {\n   658→         Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n   659→     }\n   660→\n   661→     type Writer interface {\n   662→         Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n   663→     }\n   664→\n   665→     type ReadWriter interface {\n   666→         Reader\n   667→         Writer\n   668→     }\n   669→\n   670→     // BAD: Large interface\n   671→     type Storage interface {\n   672→         Read(key string) ([]byte, error)\n   673→         Write(key string, data []byte) error\n   674→         Delete(key string) error\n   675→         List() ([]string, error)\n   676→         Close() error\n   677→         Ping() error\n   678→         Stats() (Statistics, error)\n   679→     }\n   680→     ```\n   681→\n   682→2. **Define interfaces in consumer packages, not producer packages**\n   683→   - Define interfaces where they're used, not where they're implemented\n   684→   - Keeps packages decoupled\n   685→   - Example:\n   686→     ```go\n   687→     // BAD: storage package defines interface\n   688→     package storage\n   689→     type Storage interface {\n   690→         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n   691→     }\n   692→     type PostgresStorage struct{}\n   693→     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n   694→\n   695→     // GOOD: consumer defines interface\n   696→     package handler\n   697→     type storage interface {  // lowercase, internal\n   698→         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n   699→     }\n   700→     type Handler struct {\n   701→         storage storage\n   702→     }\n   703→\n   704→     package storage\n   705→     type PostgresStorage struct{}  // Just implements it\n   706→     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n   707→     ```\n   708→\n   709→3. **Use composition over inheritance**\n   710→   - Embed types to reuse behavior\n   711→   - Promotes flexibility and clear relationships\n   712→   - Example:\n   713→     ```go\n   714→     // GOOD: Composition via embedding\n   715→     type Logger struct {\n   716→         writer io.Writer\n   717→     }\n   718→\n   719→     type HTTPLogger struct {\n   720→         Logger  // Embeds Logger\n   721→         prefix string\n   722→     }\n   723→\n   724→     // GOOD: Explicit composition\n   725→     type Service struct {\n   726→         storage Storage\n   727→         cache   Cache\n   728→         logger  Logger\n   729→     }\n   730→     ```\n   731→\n   732→4. **Order struct fields: groups by purpose, consider alignment**\n   733→   -

Small structs (< 100 bytes): can use values\n   768→   - Large structs: use pointers to avoid copies\n   769→   - Mutable structs: use pointers\n   770→   - Example:\n   771→     ```go\n   772→     // Small, immutable: use values\n   773→     type Point struct {\n   774→         X, Y int\n   775→     }\n   776→     func Translate(p Point, dx, dy int) Point\n   777→\n   778→     // Large or mutable: use pointers\n   779→     type User struct {\n   780→         ID       string\n   781→         Email    string\n   782→         Profile  Profile\n   783→         Settings Settings\n   784→         // ... many fields\n   785→     }\n   786→     func UpdateUser(u *User) error\n   787→\n   788→     type Counter struct {\n   789→         count int\n   790→     }\n   791→     func (c *Counter) Increment()\n   792→     ```\n   793→\n   794→6. **Use struct tags for metadata, keep them consistent**\n   795→   - Common tags: `json`, `yaml`, `db`, `validate`\n   796→   - Be consistent with naming conventions\n   797→   - Example:\n   798→     ```go\n   799→     type User struct {\n   800→         ID        string    `json:\"id\" db:\"user_id\"`\n   801→         Email     string    `json:\"email\" db:\"email\" validate:\"required,email\"`\n   802→         CreatedAt time.Time `json:\"created_at\" db:\"created_at\"`\n   803→         UpdatedAt time.Time `json:\"updated_at\" db:\"updated_at\"`\n   804→     }\n   805→     ```\n   806→\n   807→7. **Don't export unnecessary fields - prefer getter methods when needed**\n   808→   - Unexported fields allow you to change internal representation\n   809→   - Exported fields become part of your API\n   810→   - Example:\n   811→     ```go\n   812→     // BAD: Exposes internal state\n   813→     type Cache struct {\n   814→         Data map[string]interface{}\n   815→         Mu   sync.RWMutex\n   816→     }\n   817→\n   818→     // GOOD: Encapsulates internals\n   819→     type Cache struct {\n   820→         data map[string]interface{}\n   821→         mu   sync.RWMutex\n   822→     }\n   823→\n   824→     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {\n   825→         c.mu.RLock()\n   826→         defer c.mu.RUnlock()\n   827→         val, ok := c.data[key]\n   828→         return val, ok\n   829→     }\n   830→     ```\n   831→\n   832→## Comments & Documentation\n   833→\n   834→1. **All exported identifiers must have doc comments**\n   835→   - Start with the identifier name\n   836→   - Use complete sentences\n   837→   - Example:\n   838→     ```go\n   839→     // GOOD\n   840→     // User represents a user account in the system.\n   841→     type User struct {\n   842→         ID    string\n   843→         Email string\n   844→     }\n   845→\n   846→     // NewUser creates a new user with the given email.\n   847→     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n   848→         return &User{Email: email}\n   849→     }\n   850→\n   851→     // BAD\n   852→     // user struct\n   853→     type User struct{}\n   854→\n   855→     // creates a user\n   856→     func NewUser(email string) *User\n   857→     ```\n   858→\n   859→2. **Package comment should describe the package purpose**\n   860→   - Place in `doc.go` or at the top of any file in the package\n   861→   - Start with \"Package <name>\"\n   862→   - Example:\n   863→     ```go\n   864→     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers for the user API.\n   865→     //\n   866→     // The handlers support JSON request/response formats and include\n   867→     // built-in validation and error handling.\n   868→     package handler\n   869→     ```\n   870→\n   871→4. **Use TODO comments with issue references**\n   872→   - Format: `// TODO(#issue): description`\n   873→   - Always link to an issue or ticket\n   874→   - Example:\n   875→     ```go\n   876→     // GOOD\n   877→     // TODO(#123): Add support for pagination\n   878→     // TODO(alice): Optimize this query for large datasets\n   879→\n   880→     // BAD\n   881→     // TODO: fix this later\n   882→     // FIXME\n   883→     ```\n   884→\n   885→5. **Use examples in doc comments for complex APIs**\n   886→   -

Write clear, straightforward code**\n   - Prioritize readability over showcasing language features\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Clever one-liner\n     return len(s) > 0 && s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n\n     // GOOD: Clear and explicit\n     if len(s) == 0 {\n         return false\n     }\n     return s[0] != ' ' && s[len(s)-1] != ' '\n     ```\n\n2. **Make zero values useful - Design types so their zero value is valid and usable**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Requires constructor\n     type Buffer struct {\n         data []byte\n         size int\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Zero value ready to use\n     type Buffer struct {\n         data []byte\n     }\n     func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) {\n         b.data = append(b.data, p...)  // Works with nil slice\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Accept interfaces, return concrete types**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func NewCache(size int) Cache\n\n     // GOOD\n     func NewCache(size int) *MemoryCache\n     func ProcessData(r io.Reader) error\n     ```\n\n4. **Don't panic in library code - Return errors instead**\n   - Acceptable: `init()`, `main` package, impossible conditions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func ParseConfig(data []byte) Config {\n         var cfg Config\n         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n             panic(err)\n         }\n         return cfg\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     func ParseConfig(data []byte) (Config, error) {\n         var cfg Config\n         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n             return Config{}, fmt.Errorf(\"parse config: %w\", err)\n         }\n         return cfg, nil\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Avoid global mutable state**\n   - Use dependency injection\n   - Constants and package-level defaults are acceptable\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     var defaultClient *http.Client\n     func FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n\n     // GOOD\n     type Fetcher struct {\n         client *http.Client\n     }\n     func (f *Fetcher) FetchData(url string) ([]byte, error)\n     ```\n\n6. **Explicit is better than implicit - No magic behavior**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Hidden side effect\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string {\n         if time.Since(c.lastCleanup) > time.Hour {\n             c.cleanup()  // Surprise!\n         }\n         return c.data[key]\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Explicit operations\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) string\n     func (c *Cache) Cleanup()\n     ```\n\n7. **Never re-implement functionality from the standard library**\n   - Exception: Document performance/feature requirements\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func trimWhitespace(s string) string { /* custom impl */ }\n\n     // GOOD\n     result := strings.TrimSpace(s)\n     ```\n\n## Code Organization\n\n1. **Package structure: One package per directory, name matches directory**\n   - Package names: short, lowercase, singular\n   - Avoid: `util`, `common`, `helper`, underscores, mixed caps\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── handler/    # package handler\n     ├── storage/    # package storage\n     └── api/        # package api\n     ```\n\n2. **Organize by domain, not technical layer**\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     // BAD\n     myproject/\n     ├── models/\n     ├── controllers/\n     └── repositories/\n\n     // GOOD\n     myproject/\n     ├── user/\n     │   ├── user.go\n     │   ├── handler.go\n     │   └── storage.go\n     ├── product/\n     └── order/\n     ```\n\n3. **Always use `cmd/` directory for binaries (even single binary)**\n   - Keep `main` minimal: flag parsing, config, dependency wiring only\n   - All business logic in importable packages\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── cmd/\n     │   └── server/\n     │       └── main.go\n     ├── handler/\n     └── storage/\n     ```\n\n4. **Use `internal/` for non-exported packages**\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     myproject/\n     ├── api/              # Exported\n     └── internal/\n         ├── config/       # Cannot be imported externally\n         └── database/\n     ```\n\n5. **Import grouping: stdlib, external, internal**\n   - Use `goimports` for automatic formatting\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     import (\n         \"context\"\n         \"fmt\"\n\n         \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n\n         \"myproject/internal/config\"\n     )\n     ```\n\n6. **Keep package depth to 2-3 levels maximum**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     import \"myproject/internal/services/user/handler/http/v1\"\n\n     // GOOD\n     import \"myproject/internal/user\"\n     ```\n\n7. **Use `doc.go` for complex package documentation**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers.\n     //\n     // Example:\n     //     h := handler.New(storage)\n     //     http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", h.ListUsers)\n     package handler\n     ```\n\n8. **Organize code within files in this order**\n   - Imports\n   - Constants\n   - Type declarations (non-structs)\n   - Interfaces\n   - Structs\n   - Struct constructors\n   - Struct public methods (alphabetized)\n   - Struct private methods (alphabetized)\n   - Public functions (alphabetized)\n   - Private functions (alphabetized)\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     package user\n\n     import (\n         \"context\"\n         \"errors\"\n     )\n\n     const MaxNameLength = 100\n\n     type Role string\n\n     type Storage interface {\n         Save(ctx context.Context, u *User) error\n     }\n\n     type User struct {\n         id    string\n         email string\n     }\n\n     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n         return &User{email: email}\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) Email() string {\n         return u.email\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) Validate() error {\n         return u.validate()\n     }\n\n     func (u *User) validate() error {\n         if u.email == \"\" {\n             return errors.New(\"email required\")\n         }\n         return nil\n     }\n\n     func FormatEmail(email string) string {\n         return strings.ToLower(email)\n     }\n\n     func validateDomain(email string) bool {\n         // ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n1. **Variable names: short for small scope, descriptive for large scope**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     for i := 0; i < len(items); i++ { }\n     for _, user := range users { }\n\n     func ProcessOrder(customerID string) error {\n         var totalPrice float64\n         var validationErrors []error\n         // ...\n     }\n\n     // BAD\n     for indexCounter := 0; indexCounter < len(items); indexCounter++ { }\n     func ProcessOrder(cid string) error {\n         var tp float64\n         var ve []error\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use MixedCaps/mixedCaps, never underscores or ALL_CAPS**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     type user_service struct{}\n     const MAX_RETRY = 3\n\n     // GOOD\n     type UserService struct{}\n     const MaxRetry = 3\n     ```\n\n3. **Acronyms: all uppercase or all lowercase**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     type HttpServer struct{}\n     var userId string\n\n     // GOOD\n     type HTTPServer struct{}\n     var userID string\n     ```\n\n4. **Interfaces: describe behavior, often -er suffix**\n   - Avoid: `Interface`, `Manager`, `Helper`, `I` prefix\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     type Reader interface\n     type Validator interface\n     type Storage interface\n\n     // BAD\n     type IReader interface\n     type ReaderInterface interface\n     ```\n\n5. **Avoid package name stuttering**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: package user\n     type UserService struct{}\n\n     // GOOD: package user\n     type Service struct{}\n     // Used as: user.Service\n     ```\n\n6. **Receiver names: short (1-2 chars), consistent**\n   - Avoid: `this`, `self`, `me`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func (u *User) SetName(name string)\n     func (u *User) Name() string\n\n     // BAD\n     func (user *User) SetName(name string)\n     func (this *User) Name() string\n     ```\n\n7. **Function names: verbs; Getters omit 'Get'; Errors use 'Err' prefix**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Functions\n     func ParseConfig() (*Config, error)\n     func IsValid() bool\n\n     // Getters/Setters\n     func (u *User) Name() string          // Not GetName\n     func (u *User) SetName(name string)\n\n     // Errors\n     var ErrNotFound = errors.New(\"not found\")\n     type ValidationError struct{}\n     ```\n\n## Functions & Methods\n\n1. **Keep functions small (50-80 lines) and single-purpose**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Does fetch, validate, email, analytics\n     func ProcessUser(userID string) error { /* 100 lines */ }\n\n     // GOOD: Split into focused functions\n     func ProcessUser(userID string) error {\n         user, err := fetchUser(userID)\n         // ...\n         if err := validateUser(user); err != nil\n         if err := sendWelcomeEmail(user); err != nil\n         trackUserProcessing(user.ID)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use early returns to reduce nesting**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func Process(r *Request) error {\n         if r != nil {\n             if r.IsValid() {\n                 if r.User != nil {\n                     return process(r)\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     func Process(r *Request) error {\n         if r == nil {\n             return errors.New(\"request is nil\")\n         }\n         if !r.IsValid() {\n             return errors.New(\"invalid\")\n         }\n         if r.User == nil {\n             return errors.New(\"no user\")\n         }\n         return process(r)\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use pointer receivers by default for consistency**\n   - Exception: Small immutable types (Point, Color)\n   - Be consistent: if one method needs pointer, all methods use pointers\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type UserService struct { db *sql.DB }\n\n     func (s *UserService) GetUser(id string) (*User, error)\n     func (s *UserService) UpdateUser(user *User) error\n     ```\n\n4. **Parameter order: ctx first, required before optional, errors last**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func FetchUser(ctx context.Context, userID string, opts *Options) (*User, error)\n\n     // BAD\n     func FetchUser(opts *Options, userID string, ctx context.Context) (error, *User)\n     ```\n\n5. **Use functional options pattern for many optional parameters**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type ServerOption func(*Server)\n\n     func WithTimeout(d time.Duration) ServerOption {\n         return func(s *Server) { s.timeout = d }\n     }\n\n     func NewServer(addr string, opts ...ServerOption) *Server {\n         s := &Server{addr: addr, timeout: 30 * time.Second}\n         for _, opt := range opts {\n             opt(s)\n         }\n         return s\n     }\n\n     // Usage\n     srv := NewServer(\":8080\", WithTimeout(60*time.Second))\n     ```\n\n6. **Avoid named return values except for docs/short functions**\n   - Never use naked returns in long functions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Short function\n     func Split(path string) (dir, file string) {\n         i := strings.LastIndex(path, \"/\")\n         return path[:i], path[i+1:]\n     }\n\n     // BAD: Long function with naked return\n     func ProcessData(input []byte) (result []byte, err error) {\n         // ... 50 lines ...\n         return  // Unclear what's returned\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Group 4+ related parameters into a struct**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     func CreateUser(name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip string) (*User, error)\n\n     // GOOD\n     type CreateUserRequest struct {\n         Name    string\n         Email   string\n         Phone   string\n         Address Address\n     }\n     func CreateUser(req CreateUserRequest) (*User, error)\n     ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. **Always check errors - Never ignore them**\n   - Use `_` only when you're certain there's no error\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     data, _ := os.ReadFile(\"config.json\")\n     json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg)\n\n     // GOOD\n     data, err := os.ReadFile(\"config.json\")\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"read config: %w\", err)\n     }\n     if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"parse config: %w\", err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Wrap errors with context using `%w`**\n   - Preserves error chain for `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`\n   - Add context about what operation failed\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err  // Lost context\n     }\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"failed: %v\", err)  // Breaks error chain\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     if err != nil {\n         return fmt.Errorf(\"fetch user %s: %w\", userID, err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `errors.Is()` for sentinel errors, `errors.As()` for error types**\n   - Don't compare error strings\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err.Error() == \"not found\" { }\n     if err == io.EOF { }  // Fails if error is wrapped\n\n     // GOOD\n     if errors.Is(err, io.EOF) { }\n     if errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound) { }\n\n     var validationErr *ValidationError\n     if errors.As(err, &validationErr) {\n         // Handle validation error\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Define sentinel errors at package level, custom types when needed**\n   - Sentinel errors: simple cases with no additional data\n   - Custom types: when you need to attach context\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Sentinel errors\n     var (\n         ErrNotFound     = errors.New(\"not found\")\n         ErrUnauthorized = errors.New(\"unauthorized\")\n     )\n\n     // Custom error type with context\n     type ValidationError struct {\n         Field   string\n         Message string\n     }\n\n     func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {\n         return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s: %s\", e.Field, e.Message)\n     }\n\n     // Usage\n     if user.Email == \"\" {\n         return &ValidationError{Field: \"email\", Message: \"required\"}\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Handle errors at the appropriate level**\n   - Log at the top level (main, handlers)\n   - Add context at each level\n   - Don't log-and-return (causes duplicate logs)\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Logs at every level\n     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n         user, err := db.Query(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             log.Printf(\"database error: %v\", err)  // Don't log here\n             return nil, err\n         }\n         return user, nil\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Add context, log at top level\n     func fetchUser(id string) (*User, error) {\n         user, err := db.Query(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"query user %s: %w\", id, err)\n         }\n         return user, nil\n     }\n\n     func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n         user, err := fetchUser(id)\n         if err != nil {\n             log.Printf(\"fetch user failed: %v\", err)  // Log here\n             http.Error(w, \"internal error\", 500)\n             return\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Return early on errors - don't use else blocks**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err\n     } else {\n         // continue processing\n         result := process(data)\n         return nil\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     if err != nil {\n         return err\n     }\n     result := process(data)\n     return nil\n     ```\n\n7. **Use defer for cleanup, even on error paths**\n   - Ensures resources are released\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     func processFile(path string) error {\n         f, err := os.Open(path)\n         if err != nil {\n             return err\n         }\n         defer f.Close()  // Always closes, even on error\n\n         // Process file...\n         if err := process(f); err != nil {\n             return err  // File still closes\n         }\n         return nil\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Interfaces & Types\n\n1. **Keep interfaces small - prefer single-method interfaces**\n   - Easier to implement and test\n   - More composable and flexible\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Small, focused interfaces\n     type Reader interface {\n         Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n     }\n\n     type Writer interface {\n         Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n     }\n\n     type ReadWriter interface {\n         Reader\n         Writer\n     }\n\n     // BAD: Large interface\n     type Storage interface {\n         Read(key string) ([]byte, error)\n         Write(key string, data []byte) error\n         Delete(key string) error\n         List() ([]string, error)\n         Close() error\n         Ping() error\n         Stats() (Statistics, error)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Define interfaces in consumer packages, not producer packages**\n   - Define interfaces where they're used, not where they're implemented\n   - Keeps packages decoupled\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: storage package defines interface\n     package storage\n     type Storage interface {\n         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     }\n     type PostgresStorage struct{}\n     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n\n     // GOOD: consumer defines interface\n     package handler\n     type storage interface {  // lowercase, internal\n         Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     }\n     type Handler struct {\n         storage storage\n     }\n\n     package storage\n     type PostgresStorage struct{}  // Just implements it\n     func (p *PostgresStorage) Get(key string) ([]byte, error)\n     ```\n\n3. **Use composition over inheritance**\n   - Embed types to reuse behavior\n   - Promotes flexibility and clear relationships\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Composition via embedding\n     type Logger struct {\n         writer io.Writer\n     }\n\n     type HTTPLogger struct {\n         Logger  // Embeds Logger\n         prefix string\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Explicit composition\n     type Service struct {\n         storage Storage\n         cache   Cache\n         logger  Logger\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Order struct fields: groups by purpose, consider alignment**\n   - Group related fields together\n   - Consider memory alignment for hot-path structs\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD: Grouped by purpose\n     type Server struct {\n         // Connection settings\n         addr string\n         port int\n\n         // Timeouts\n         readTimeout  time.Duration\n         writeTimeout time.Duration\n\n         // Dependencies\n         storage Storage\n         logger  Logger\n\n         // Internal state\n         mu      sync.Mutex\n         running bool\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Optimized for alignment (hot path)\n     type Event struct {\n         timestamp int64   // 8 bytes\n         userID    int64   // 8 bytes\n         eventType int32   // 4 bytes\n         flags     int32   // 4 bytes\n         name      string  // 16 bytes\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Use pointers for large structs or when mutability is needed**\n   - Small structs (< 100 bytes): can use values\n   - Large structs: use pointers to avoid copies\n   - Mutable structs: use pointers\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Small, immutable: use values\n     type Point struct {\n         X, Y int\n     }\n     func Translate(p Point, dx, dy int) Point\n\n     // Large or mutable: use pointers\n     type User struct {\n         ID       string\n         Email    string\n         Profile  Profile\n         Settings Settings\n         // ... many fields\n     }\n     func UpdateUser(u *User) error\n\n     type Counter struct {\n         count int\n     }\n     func (c *Counter) Increment()\n     ```\n\n6. **Use struct tags for metadata, keep them consistent**\n   - Common tags: `json`, `yaml`, `db`, `validate`\n   - Be consistent with naming conventions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     type User struct {\n         ID        string    `json:\"id\" db:\"user_id\"`\n         Email     string    `json:\"email\" db:\"email\" validate:\"required,email\"`\n         CreatedAt time.Time `json:\"created_at\" db:\"created_at\"`\n         UpdatedAt time.Time `json:\"updated_at\" db:\"updated_at\"`\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Don't export unnecessary fields - prefer getter methods when needed**\n   - Unexported fields allow you to change internal representation\n   - Exported fields become part of your API\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Exposes internal state\n     type Cache struct {\n         Data map[string]interface{}\n         Mu   sync.RWMutex\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Encapsulates internals\n     type Cache struct {\n         data map[string]interface{}\n         mu   sync.RWMutex\n     }\n\n     func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {\n         c.mu.RLock()\n         defer c.mu.RUnlock()\n         val, ok := c.data[key]\n         return val, ok\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Comments & Documentation\n\n1. **All exported identifiers must have doc comments**\n   - Start with the identifier name\n   - Use complete sentences\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     // User represents a user account in the system.\n     type User struct {\n         ID    string\n         Email string\n     }\n\n     // NewUser creates a new user with the given email.\n     func NewUser(email string) *User {\n         return &User{Email: email}\n     }\n\n     // BAD\n     // user struct\n     type User struct{}\n\n     // creates a user\n     func NewUser(email string) *User\n     ```\n\n2. **Package comment should describe the package purpose**\n   - Place in `doc.go` or at the top of any file in the package\n   - Start with \"Package <name>\"\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // Package handler provides HTTP request handlers for the user API.\n     //\n     // The handlers support JSON request/response formats and include\n     // built-in validation and error handling.\n     package handler\n     ```\n\n4. **Use TODO comments with issue references**\n   - Format: `// TODO(#issue): description`\n   - Always link to an issue or ticket\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // GOOD\n     // TODO(#123): Add support for pagination\n     // TODO(alice): Optimize this query for large datasets\n\n     // BAD\n     // TODO: fix this later\n     // FIXME\n     ```\n\n5. **Use examples in doc comments for complex APIs**\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // ProcessBatch processes multiple items in parallel.\n     //\n     // Example:\n     //\n     //     items := []Item{{ID: \"1\"}, {ID: \"2\"}}\n     //     results, err := ProcessBatch(ctx, items, 10)\n     //     if err != nil {\n     //         log.Fatal(err)\n     //     }\n     //\n     func ProcessBatch(ctx context.Context, items []Item, workers int) ([]Result, error)\n     ```\n","numLines":900,"startLine":1,"totalLines":900}}}

Focus on testing the public API and observable behavior\n     9→   - Avoid testing private functions directly\n    10→   - Don't rely on specific internal state\n    11→   - Example:\n    12→     ```go\n    13→     // BAD: Testing internal state\n    14→     if cache.internalMap[\"key\"] != expected {\n    15→         t.Error(\"internal map mismatch\")\n    16→     }\n    17→\n    18→     // GOOD: Testing behavior\n    19→     got := cache.Get(\"key\")\n    20→     if got != expected {\n    21→         t.Errorf(\"Get(key) = %v, want %v\", got, expected)\n    22→     }\n    23→     ```\n    24→\n    25→2. **Unit tests must NEVER have external dependencies**\n    26→   - No network calls (HTTP, gRPC, database connections, etc.)\n    27→   - No real filesystem access (except temporary filesystem when required)\n    28→   - Use mocks or in-memory implementations for external dependencies\n    29→   - Tests with external dependencies are integration tests, not unit tests\n    30→   - Exception: `os.CreateTemp()`, `t.TempDir()` and similar temporary filesystem operations are acceptable\n    31→   - Example:\n    32→     ```go\n    33→     // BAD: External dependency in unit test\n    34→     func TestFetchUser(t *testing.T) {\n    35→         resp, err := http.Get(\"https://api.example.com/user/123\")\n    36→         // ...\n    37→     }\n    38→\n    39→     // GOOD: Mock the external dependency\n    40→     func TestFetchUser(t *testing.T) {\n    41→         client := &mockHTTPClient{\n    42→             getFunc: func(url string) (*Response, error) {\n    43→                 return &Response{Status: 200, Body: `{\"id\": 123}`}, nil\n    44→             },\n    45→         }\n    46→         svc := NewService(client)\n    47→         // ...\n    48→     }\n    49→\n    50→     // ACCEPTABLE: Temporary filesystem\n    51→     func TestWriteConfig(t *testing.T) {\n    52→         dir := t.TempDir()\n    53→         configPath := filepath.Join(dir, \"config.json\")\n    54→         // test logic with temporary directory\n    55→     }\n    56→     ```\n    57→\n    58→3. **Don't test constants or functions with no logic**\n    59→   - Don't write tests for constant values\n    60→   - Don't test trivial constructors that only assign parameters to struct fields\n    61→   - Don't test functions with no logic (simple getters, setters with no validation)\n    62→   - Focus testing efforts on code with actual logic, branching, or transformations\n    63→   - Example:\n    64→     ```go\n    65→     // BAD: Testing constants\n    66→     func TestMaxRetries(t *testing.T) {\n    67→         if MaxRetries != 3 {\n    68→             t.Errorf(\"MaxRetries = %d, want 3\", MaxRetries)\n    69→         }\n    70→     }\n    71→\n    72→     // BAD: Testing trivial constructor\n    73→     func TestNewUser(t *testing.T) {\n    74→         user := NewUser(\"John\", 30)\n    75→         if user.Name != \"John\" {\n    76→             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", user.Name, \"John\")\n    77→         }\n    78→         if user.Age != 30 {\n    79→             t.Errorf(\"Age = %d, want %d\", user.Age, 30)\n    80→         }\n    81→     }\n    82→\n    83→     // Where NewUser is just:\n    84→     // func NewUser(name string, age int) User {\n    85→     //     return User{Name: name, Age: age}\n    86→     // }\n    87→\n    88→     // GOOD: Test functions with actual logic\n    89→     func TestValidateUser(t *testing.T) {\n    90→         user := User{Name: \"\", Age: -1}\n    91→         err := user.Validate()\n    92→         if err == nil {\n    93→             t.Error(\"expected validation error for invalid user\")\n    94→         }\n    95→     }\n    96→     ```\n    97→\n    98→4. **Strive for 80% behavioral coverage, not line coverage**\n    99→   - Focus on testing 80% of behaviors and use cases, not 80% of lines executed\n   100→   - Line coverage metrics can be misleading - executing a line doesn't mean the behavior is tested\n   101→   - A single test can execute many lines but only test one behavior\n   102→   - Multiple tests may be needed to cover all behaviors in a single function\n   103→   - Example:\n   104→     ```go\n   105→     // This function has multiple behaviors to test:\n   106→     func ProcessOrder(order *Order) error {\n   107→         if order == nil {\n   108→             return ErrNilOrder\n   109→         }\n   110→         if order.Total < 0 {\n   111→             return ErrNegativeTotal\n   112→         }\n   113→         if order.Items == nil || len(order.Items) == 0 {\n   114→             return ErrNoItems\n   115→         }\n   116→         // process order\n   117→         return nil\n   118→     }\n   119→\n   120→     // GOOD: Test each behavior separately\n   121→     // - Behavior: nil order returns error\n   122→     // - Behavior: negative total returns error\n   123→     // - Behavior: empty items returns error\n   124→     // - Behavior: valid order processes successfully\n   125→     // This is 4 behaviors, and we should test all 4 (100% behavioral coverage)\n   126→\n   127→     // BAD: One test that executes all lines but only tests success case\n   128→     // This would give high line coverage but poor behavioral coverage\n   129→     func TestProcessOrder(t *testing.T) {\n   130→         order := &Order{Total: 100, Items: []Item{{ID: 1}}}\n   131→         err := ProcessOrder(order)\n   132→         if err != nil {\n   133→             t.Errorf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n   134→         }\n   135→     }\n   136→     ```\n   137→\n   138→## Test Organization\n   139→\n   140→1. **Test files must be named with `_test.go` suffix, matching the source file name**\n   141→   - Pattern: For `foo.go`, create `foo_test.go`\n   142→   - Place test files in the same directory as the code being tested\n   143→   - When splitting tests across multiple files, maintain the prefix: `foo_test.go`, `foo_integration_test.go`, `foo_benchmark_test.go`\n   144→   - Examples: `handler.go` → `handler_test.go`; `user.go` → `user_test.go`, `user_validation_test.go`\n   145→\n   146→2. **Always use the same package name as the code being tested**\n   147→   - Use `package mypackage`, not `package mypackage_test`\n   148→   - This allows tests to access both exported and unexported functions/types\n   149→   - Example: If testing `package handler`, use `package handler` in test files\n   150→\n   151→3. **Name test functions with `Test` prefix followed by the function/feature being tested**\n   152→   - Pattern: `func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T)`\n   153→   - For package-level functions: `func TestValidateEmail(t *testing.T)`\n   154→   - For methods: `func TestUser_Login(t *testing.T)` or `func TestUser_Validate(t *testing.T)`\n   155→     - Use the pattern `TestTypeName_MethodName`\n   156→   - For specific scenarios: `func TestUser_Login_InvalidPassword(t *testing.T)`\n   157→\n   158→4. **Place mocks appropriately based on reusability**\n   159→   - Single-use mocks: Keep inline within the test file where they're used\n   160→   - Large single-use mocks: Extract to `mypkg_mocks_test.go` in the same directory\n   161→   - Reusable mocks: Place in a `mocks` subpackage within the current package\n   162→     - Directory structure: `mypkg/mocks/`\n   163→     - File naming: Match the source file being mocked (e.g., `mypkg/client.go` → `mypkg/mocks/client.go`)\n   164→     - Example: `handler/mocks/storage.go` for mocks of `handler/storage.go`\n   165→\n   166→5. **Place shared test helpers in a `testutils` package at the module root**\n   167→   - Single-use test helpers: Keep inline within the test file or in `mypkg_test_helpers.go`\n   168→   - Shared test helpers used across multiple packages: Place in `testutils` package at module root\n   169→     - Directory structure: `<module-root>/testutils/`\n   170→     - Example: `mymodule/testutils/assertions.go`, `mymodule/testutils/fixtures.go`\n   171→   - Mark helper functions with `t.Helper()` to ensure correct line numbers in error reports\n   172→\n   173→6. **Group related tests in the same file**\n   174→   - All tests for `User.Validate()` should be in the same test file\n   175→   - Split into multiple test files only when a single file becomes unwieldy (>500-1000 lines)\n   176→\n   177→## Test Structure\n   178→\n   179→1. **Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases**\n   180→   - Define test cases as a slice of structs\n   181→   - Each test case should have a `name` field for identification\n   182→   - Example structure:\n   183→     ```go\n   184→     func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {\n   185→         tests := []struct {\n   186→             name string\n   187→             a, b int\n   188→             want int\n   189→         }{\n   190→             {name: \"positive numbers\", a: 2, b: 3, want: 5},\n   191→             {name: \"negative numbers\", a: -1, b: -1, want: -2},\n   192→             {name: \"zero\", a: 0, b: 0, want: 0},\n   193→         }\n   194→         for _, tt := range tests {\n   195→             t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n   196→                 got := Add(tt.a, tt.b)\n   197→                 if got != tt.want {\n   198→                     t.Errorf(\"Add(%d, %d) = %d, want %d\", tt.a, tt.b, got, tt.want)\n   199→                 }\n   200→             })\n   201→         }\n   202→     }\n   203→     ```\n   204→\n   205→2. **Always use subtests with `t.Run()` for table-driven tests**\n   206→   - Allows running individual test cases: `go test -run TestAdd/positive`\n   207→   - Provides clear test output showing which case failed\n   208→   - Enables parallel execution of test cases when appropriate\n   209→\n   210→3. **For complex table-driven tests, extract validation and setup logic**\n   211→   - Add a `validate` function field to the test struct for complex validation instead of inline assertions\n   212→   - If `validate` takes more than 3 arguments, wrap return data in an inline type\n   213→   - Use a `setup()` function for conditional setup instead of adding many fields to the test struct\n   214→     - Exception: Simple tests with uniform setup or only a few toggle fields can skip `setup()`\n   215→   - Example:\n   216→     ```go\n   217→     func TestComplexOperation(t *testing.T) {\n   218→         type result struct {\n   219→             data   []byte\n   220→             status int\n   221→             meta   map[string]string\n   222→         }\n   223→\n   224→         tests := []struct {\n   225→             name      string\n   226→             input     string\n   227→             setupOpts []SetupOption // instead of: useCache bool, enableRetry bool, timeout int, etc.\n   228→             want      result\n   229→             validate  func(t *testing.T, got result)\n   230→         }{\n   231→             {\n   232→                 name:      \"case1\",\n   233→                 input:     \"...\",\n   234→                 setupOpts: []SetupOption{WithCache(), WithRetry()},\n   235→                 want:      result{...},\n   236→                 validate: func(t *testing.T, got result) {\n   237→                     if got.status != tt.want.status {\n   238→                         t.Errorf(\"status = %d, want %d\", got.status, tt.want.status)\n   239→                     }\n   240→                     // additional complex validation logic\n   241→                 },\n   242→             },\n   243→         }\n   244→\n   245→         for _, tt := range tests {\n   246→             t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n   247→                 svc := setup(t, tt.setupOpts...)\n   248→                 got := svc.Execute(tt.input)\n   249→                 tt.validate(t, got)\n   250→             })\n   251→         }\n   252→     }\n   253→     ```\n   254→\n   255→4. **Use `t.Run()` to separate multiple test cases, even in non-table-driven tests**\n   256→   - When a test function covers multiple scenarios, use subtests for each\n   257→   - Single test case scenarios can omit `t.Run()`\n   258→   - Example:\n   259→     ```go\n   260→     func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {\n   261→         t.Run(\"create user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n   262→             // test user creation\n   263→         })\n   264→\n   265→         t.Run(\"update user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n   266→             // test user update\n   267→         })\n   268→\n   269→         t.Run(\"delete user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n   270→             // test user deletion\n   271→         })\n   272→     }\n   273→     ```\n   274→\n   275→4. **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**\n   276→   - Arrange: Set up test data and preconditions\n   277→   - Act: Execute the code being tested\n   278→   - Assert: Verify the results\n   279→   - Use blank lines to visually separate these sections\n   280→   - Example:\n   281→     ```go\n   282→     func TestUserValidate(t *testing.T) {\n   283→         user := User{Name: \"John\", Email: \"invalid\"}\n   284→         err := user.Validate()\n   285→         if err == nil {\n   286→             t.Error(\"expected validation error, got nil\")\n   287→         }\n   288→     }\n   289→     ```\n   290→\n   291→4. **Keep test cases independent and isolated**\n   292→   - Each test should set up its own data\n   293→   - Avoid shared mutable state between tests\n   294→   - Clean up resources using `t.Cleanup()` or defer\n   295→   - Tests should pass when run individually or as part of the suite\n   296→\n   297→## Test Helpers & Utilities\n   298→\n   299→1. **Use `testify/assert` and `testify/require` for all assertions**\n   300→   - Import `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for assertions that allow the test to continue\n   301→   - Import `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for assertions where the test must stop on failure\n   302→   - `assert` maps to `t.Error()` behavior (test continues)\n   303→   - `require` maps to `t.Fatal()` behavior (test stops immediately)\n   304→   - Example:\n   305→     ```go\n   306→     import (\n   307→         \"testing\"\n   308→         \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n   309→         \"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\"\n   310→     )\n   311→\n   312→     func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {\n   313→         // Use require for setup/preconditions that must succeed\n   314→         db, err := setupTestDB()\n   315→         require.NoError(t, err, \"failed to setup test database\")\n   316→         require.NotNil(t, db)\n   317→\n   318→         // Use assert for multiple assertions that should all be checked\n   319→         user := GetUser(db, \"123\")\n   320→         assert.Equal(t, \"John\", user.Name)\n   321→         assert.Equal(t, 30, user.Age)\n   322→         assert.True(t, user.IsActive)\n   323→     }\n   324→     ```\n   325→\n   326→2. **Always use `t.Helper()` in test helper functions**\n   327→   - Mark helper functions with `t.Helper()` as the first line\n   328→   - Ensures error messages point to the calling test, not the helper\n   329→   - Example:\n   330→     ```go\n   331→     func assertUser(t *testing.T, got, want User) {\n   332→         t.Helper()\n   333→         if got.Name != want.Name {\n   334→             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", got.Name, want.Name)\n   335→         }\n   336→     }\n   337→     ```\n   338→\n   339→3. **Use `t.Cleanup()` for resource cleanup**\n   340→   - Prefer `t.Cleanup()` over defer for test cleanup\n   341→   - Cleanup functions run in LIFO order after test completion\n   342→   - Works correctly with subtests and parallel tests\n   343→   - Example:\n   344→     ```go\n   345→     func TestWithTempFile(t *testing.T) {\n   346→         f, err := os.CreateTemp(\"\", \"test\")\n   347→         if err != nil {\n   348→             t.Fatal(err)\n   349→         }\n   350→         t.Cleanup(func() {\n   351→             os.Remove(f.Name())\n   352→         })\n   353→         // test code\n   354→     }\n   355→     ```\n   356→\n   357→4. **Create test fixtures in a consistent location**\n   358→   - Place test data files in a `testdata` directory\n   359→   - Go tools ignore `testdata` directories by convention\n   360→   - Structure: `package/testdata/fixture.json`\n   361→   - Example:\n   362→     ```go\n   363→     func loadFixture(t *testing.T, name string) []byte {\n   364→         t.Helper()\n   365→         data, err := os.ReadFile(filepath.Join(\"testdata\", name))\n   366→         if err != nil {\n   367→             t.Fatalf(\"failed to load fixture %s: %v\", name, err)\n   368→         }\n   369→         return data\n   370→     }\n   371→     ```\n   372→\n   373→5. **Use golden files for complex output validation**\n   374→   - Store expected output in `testdata/*.golden` files\n   375→   - Compare actual output against golden files\n   376→   - Update golden files with `-update` flag pattern\n   377→   - Example:\n   378→     ```go\n   379→     var update = flag.Bool(\"update\", false, \"update golden files\")\n   380→\n   381→     func TestRender(t *testing.T) {\n   382→         got := Render(input)\n   383→         golden := filepath.Join(\"testdata\", \"output.golden\")\n   384→\n   385→         if *update {\n   386→             os.WriteFile(golden, got, 0644)\n   387→         }\n   388→\n   389→         want, _ := os.ReadFile(golden)\n   390→         if !bytes.Equal(got, want) {\n   391→             t.Errorf(\"output mismatch\")\n   392→         }\n   393→     }\n   394→     ```\n   395→\n   396→## Error Handling\n   397→\n   398→1. **Use `t.Fatal()` when the test cannot continue after a failure**\n   399→   - Use `t.Fatal()` or `t.Fatalf()` for setup failures or preconditions\n   400→   - Stops test execution immediately\n   401→   - Example: Failed to create test resources, nil pointer checks\n   402→   - Example:\n   403→     ```go\n   404→     func TestProcess(t *testing.T) {\n   405→         f, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n   406→         if err != nil {\n   407→             t.Fatalf(\"failed to open file: %v\", err)\n   408→         }\n   409→         // test continues only if file opened successfully\n   410→     }\n   411→     ```\n   412→\n   413→2. **Use `t.Error()` when the test can continue after a failure**\n   414→   - Use `t.Error()` or `t.Errorf()` for assertion failures\n   415→   - Allows multiple assertions to be checked in a single test run\n   416→   - Example:\n   417→     ```go\n   418→     func TestUser(t *testing.T) {\n   419→         user := GetUser()\n   420→         if user.Name != \"John\" {\n   421→             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", user.Name, \"John\")\n   422→         }\n   423→         if user.Age != 30 {\n   424→             t.Errorf(\"Age = %d, want %d\", user.Age, 30)\n   425→         }\n   426→         // both errors will be reported\n   427→     }\n   428→     ```\n   429→\n   430→3. **Test error values using `errors.Is()` and error types using `errors.As()`**\n   431→   - Use `errors.Is()` to check if an error matches a sentinel error\n   432→   - Use `errors.As()` to check if an error is of a specific type\n   433→   - Don't compare error strings directly\n   434→   - Example:\n   435→     ```go\n   436→     func TestValidate(t *testing.T) {\n   437→         err := Validate(input)\n   438→\n   439→         // Check sentinel error\n   440→         if !errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidInput) {\n   441→             t.Errorf(\"expected ErrInvalidInput, got %v\", err)\n   442→         }\n   443→\n   444→         // Check error type\n   445→         var validationErr *ValidationError\n   446→         if !errors.As(err, &validationErr) {\n   447→             t.Errorf(\"expected ValidationError, got %T\", err)\n   448→         }\n   449→     }\n   450→     ```\n   451→\n   452→4. **When testing for expected errors, verify both presence and type**\n   453→   - Don't just check `err != nil`, verify it's the correct error\n   454→   - Include error details in failure messages\n   455→   - Example:\n   456→     ```go\n   457→     tests := []struct {\n   458→         name    string\n   459→         input   string\n   460→         wantErr error\n   461→     }{\n   462→         {name: \"invalid email\", input: \"bad\", wantErr: ErrInvalidEmail},\n   463→         {name: \"valid email\", input: \"test@example.com\", wantErr: nil},\n   464→     }\n   465→\n   466→     for _, tt := range tests {\n   467→         t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n   468→             err := ValidateEmail(tt.input)\n   469→             if !errors.Is(err, tt.wantErr) {\n   470→                 t.Errorf(\"got error %v, want %v\", err, tt.wantErr)\n   471→             }\n   472→         })\n   473→     }\n   474→     ```\n   475→\n   476→## Mocking & Dependencies\n   477→\n   478→1. **All public interfaces must have mocks generated via `moq`**\n   479→   - Generate mocks for all exported interfaces\n   480→   - Place generated mocks in the `mocks` subpackage (see Test Organization rule 4)\n   481→   - Use `go generate` with a generation comment\n   482→   - Prefer `go run` to avoid requiring `moq` to be installed locally\n   483→   - Pin `moq` to a recent version\n   484→   - Example:\n   485→     ```go\n   486→     // In storage.go\n   487→     package handler\n   488→\n   489→     //go:generate go run github.com/matryer/moq@latest -out mocks/storage.go . Storage\n   490→\n   491→     type Storage interface {\n   492→         Get(id string) (*Item, error)\n   493→         Save(item *Item) error\n   494→     }\n   495→     ```\n   496→\n   497→2. **Use `moq` for consumed interfaces, except for simple cases**\n   498→   - Generate mocks for external interfaces you depend on\n   499→   - Exception: If testing only 1-2 methods, inline mocks are acceptable\n   500→   - Follow the same `go generate` pattern as public interfaces\n   501→   - Example of acceptable inline mock:\n   502→     ```go\n   503→     type mockStorage struct {\n   504→         getFunc func(id string) (*Item, error)\n   505→     }\n   506→\n   507→     func (m *mockStorage) Get(id string) (*Item, error) {\n   508→         return m.getFunc(id)\n   509→     }\n   510→     ```\n   511→\n   512→3. **NEVER mock internal logic or implementation details**\n   513→   - Mocks should ONLY be used to control data returned from external dependencies\n   514→   - Do NOT check that mocks were called with specific parameters\n   515→   - Do NOT count the number of times a mock was called\n   516→   - Do NOT verify the order of mock calls\n   517→   - Invalid example (DO NOT DO THIS):\n   518→     ```go\n   519→     // BAD: Testing implementation details\n   520→     mock.AssertCalled(t, \"Save\", specificItem)\n   521→     mock.AssertNumberOfCalls(t, \"Get\", 3)\n   522→     ```\n   523→\n   524→4. **Use mocks only to provide test data, not to verify behavior**\n   525→   - Valid use: Return test data or errors from external dependencies\n   526→   - Invalid use: Asserting on how the mock was used\n   527→   - Test behavior through observable outputs, not mock interactions\n   528→   - Example:\n   529→     ```go\n   530→     func TestUserService_Create(t *testing.T) {\n   531→         // GOOD: Mock returns test data\n   532→         storage := &mockStorage{\n   533→             saveFunc: func(item *Item) error {\n   534→                 return nil // or return an error to test error handling\n   535→             },\n   536→         }\n   537→\n   538→         svc := NewUserService(storage)\n   539→         err := svc.Create(user)\n   540→\n   541→         // GOOD: Assert on the actual result\n   542→         if err != nil {\n   543→             t.Errorf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n   544→         }\n   545→\n   546→         // BAD: Don't assert on mock internals\n   547→         // if !storage.saveCalled { ... }\n   548→     }\n   549→     ```\n   550→\n   551→## Concurrency\n   552→\n   553→1. **Always run tests with the race detector enabled**\n   554→   - Use `go test -race` to detect data races\n   555→   - Run race detector in CI/CD pipelines\n   556→   - Example:\n   557→     ```bash\n   558→     go test -race ./...\n   559→     ```\n   560→\n   561→2. **Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests that can run concurrently**\n   562→   - Mark tests as parallel when they don't share mutable state\n   563→   - Speeds up test execution\n   564→   - Place `t.Parallel()` at the start of the test function\n   565→   - Example:\n   566→     ```go\n   567→     func TestUserValidation(t *testing.T) {\n   568→         t.Parallel() // This test can run in parallel with others\n   569→\n   570→         user := User{Name: \"John\"}\n   571→         err := user.Validate()\n   572→         // assertions\n   573→     }\n   574→     ```\n   575→\n   576→3. **Use synchronization primitives to test goroutines safely**\n   577→   - Use `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for goroutines to complete\n   578→   - Use channels to coordinate and receive results\n   579→   - Don't rely on `time.Sleep()` for synchronization\n   580→   - Example:\n   581→     ```go\n   582→     func TestConcurrentWrites(t *testing.T) {\n   583→         var wg sync.WaitGroup\n   584→         cache := NewCache()\n   585→\n   586→         for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n   587→             wg.Add(1)\n   588→             go func(val int) {\n   589→                 defer wg.Done()\n   590→                 cache.Set(fmt.Sprintf(\"key%d\", val), val)\n   591→             }(i)\n   592→         }\n   593→\n   594→         wg.Wait()\n   595→         // assertions\n   596→     }\n   597→     ```\n   598→\n   599→4. **Test timeout scenarios using contexts with deadlines**\n   600→   - Use `context.WithTimeout()` or `context.WithDeadline()` for timeout tests\n   601→   - Verify that operations respect context cancellation\n   602→   - Example:\n   603→     ```go\n   604→     func TestOperation_Timeout(t *testing.T) {\n   605→         ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Millisecond)\n   606→         defer cancel()\n   607→\n   608→         err := LongRunningOperation(ctx)\n   609→\n   610→         if !errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) {\n   611→             t.Errorf(\"expected context.DeadlineExceeded, got %v\", err)\n   612→         }\n   613→     }\n   614→     ```\n   615→\n   616→5. **Use channels with timeouts to prevent test hangs**\n   617→   - When testing goroutines that send results via channels, always use timeouts\n   618→   - Prevents tests from hanging indefinitely if goroutines fail\n   619→   - Example:\n   620→     ```go\n   621→     func TestAsyncOperation(t *testing.T) {\n   622→         result := make(chan string, 1)\n   623→\n   624→         go func() {\n   625→             result <- PerformOperation()\n   626→         }()\n   627→\n   628→         select {\n   629→         case got := <-result:\n   630→             if got != \"expected\" {\n   631→                 t.Errorf(\"got %q, want %q\", got, \"expected\")\n   632→             }\n   633→         case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):\n   634→             t.Fatal(\"test timed out waiting for result\")\n   635→         }\n   636→     }\n   637→     ```\n   638→\n   639→## Integration Testing\n   640→\n   641→1. **Integration tests must always be behind a build flag**\n   642→   - Use build tags to separate integration tests from unit tests\n   643→   - Prevents integration tests from running by default with `go test ./...`\n   644→   - Run integration tests explicitly with `go test -tags=integration ./...`\n   645→   - Example:\n   646→     ```go\n   647→     //go:build integration\n   648→     // +build integration\n   649→\n   650→     package mypackage\n   651→\n   652→     import \"testing\"\n   653→\n   654→     func TestDatabaseIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n   655→         // integration test code\n   656→     }\n   657→     ```\n   658→\n   659→2. **Integration tests must NEVER rely on services running outside the user's machine**\n   660→   - All external dependencies must be managed within the test\n   661→   - Don't assume databases, APIs, or other services are already running\n   662→   - Don't rely on shared test environments or infrastructure\n   663→   - Tests should be fully self-contained and reproducible\n   664→\n   665→3. **Use `testcontainers` for spinning up real service instances**\n   666→   - Prefer `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go` for most external services\n   667→   - Provides real instances of databases, message queues, caches, etc.\n   668→   - Tests run against actual service implementations, not mocks\n   669→   - Example:\n   670→     ```go\n   671→     //go:build integration\n   672→     // +build integration\n   673→\n   674→     package mypackage\n   675→\n   676→     import (\n   677→         \"context\"\n   678→         \"testing\"\n   679→         \"github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go\"\n   680→         \"github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/wait\"\n   681→     )\n   682→\n   683→     func TestWithPostgres(t *testing.T) {\n   684→         ctx := context.Background()\n   685→\n   686→         req := testcontainers.ContainerRequest{\n   687→             Image:        \"postgres:15\",\n   688→             ExposedPorts: []string{\"5432/tcp\"},\n   689→             Env: map[string]string{\n   690→                 \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD\": \"test\",\n   691→                 \"POSTGRES_DB\":       \"testdb\",\n   692→             },\n   693→             WaitingFor: wait.ForLog(\"database system is ready to accept connections\"),\n   694→         }\n   695→\n   696→         container, err := testcontainers.GenericContainer(ctx, testcontainers.GenericContainerRequest{\n   697→             ContainerRequest: req,\n   698→             Started:          true,\n   699→         })\n   700→         require.NoError(t, err)\n   701→         t.Cleanup(func() {\n   702→             container.Terminate(ctx)\n   703→         })\n   704→\n   705→         // Get connection details and run tests\n   706→         host, _ := container.Host(ctx)\n   707→         port, _ := container.MappedPort(ctx, \"5432\")\n   708→         // test logic\n   709→     }\n   710→     ```\n   711→\n   712→4. **For services incompatible with `testcontainers`, use docker-compose**\n   713→   - Create `docker-compose.test.yml` files to define the test environment\n   714→   - Use environment variables for configuration (ports, passwords, hostnames)\n   715→   - Document the docker-compose setup in test file comments or README\n   716→   - Example docker-compose.test.yml:\n   717→     ```yaml\n   718→     version: '3.8'\n   719→     services:\n   720→       redis:\n   721→         image: redis:7\n   722→         ports:\n   723→           -

\"${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432\"\n   731→     ```\n   732→   - Example test:\n   733→     ```go\n   734→     //go:build integration\n   735→     // +build integration\n   736→\n   737→     func TestWithDockerCompose(t *testing.T) {\n   738→         // Read config from environment variables\n   739→         redisAddr := fmt.Sprintf(\"localhost:%s\", getEnv(\"REDIS_PORT\", \"6379\"))\n   740→         pgHost := getEnv(\"POSTGRES_HOST\", \"localhost\")\n   741→         pgPort := getEnv(\"POSTGRES_PORT\", \"5432\")\n   742→\n   743→         // test logic using these connection details\n   744→     }\n   745→     ```\n   746→\n   747→5. **In-process HTTP test servers are NOT valid integration tests**\n   748→   - Using `httptest.Server` to mock external APIs is NOT an integration test\n   749→   - In-process mocks only test your ability to emulate a service, not the actual service behavior\n   750→   - Integration tests must use real service instances (via testcontainers or docker-compose)\n   751→   - Example of what NOT to do:\n   752→     ```go\n   753→     // BAD: This is NOT an integration test, it's a unit test with a mock\n   754→     func TestAPIIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n   755→         server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n   756→             w.WriteHeader(200)\n   757→             w.Write([]byte(`{\"status\": \"ok\"}`))\n   758→         }))\n   759→         defer server.Close()\n   760→\n   761→         // This only tests that you can parse your own mock response\n   762→         // It does NOT test integration with the real API\n   763→     }\n   764→     ```\n   765→\n   766→## Common Pitfalls\n   767→\n   768→1. **Don't use `panic()` in tests**\n   769→   - Use `t.Fatal()` or `t.Fatalf()` instead of `panic()`\n   770→   - `panic()` stops the entire test suite, not just the current test\n   771→   - Example:\n   772→     ```go\n   773→     // BAD\n   774→     if err != nil {\n   775→         panic(err)\n   776→     }\n   777→\n   778→     // GOOD\n   779→     if err != nil {\n   780→         t.Fatalf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n   781→     }\n   782→     ```\n   783→\n   784→2. **Avoid global state and shared mutable variables**\n   785→   - Global variables can cause flaky tests and race conditions\n   786→   - Tests can interfere with each other when modifying shared state\n   787→   - Each test should create its own isolated data\n   788→   - Example:\n   789→     ```go\n   790→     // BAD: Global shared state\n   791→     var testCache = make(map[string]string)\n   792→\n   793→     func TestA(t *testing.T) {\n   794→         testCache[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n   795→         // test logic\n   796→     }\n   797→\n   798→     // GOOD: Isolated state per test\n   799→     func TestA(t *testing.T) {\n   800→         cache := make(map[string]string)\n   801→         cache[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n   802→         // test logic\n   803→     }\n   804→     ```\n   805→\n   806→3. **Don't ignore test cleanup**\n   807→   - Always clean up resources (files, network connections, databases)\n   808→   - Use `t.Cleanup()` or `defer` to ensure cleanup happens\n   809→   - Leaked resources can cause subsequent tests to fail\n   810→   - Example:\n   811→     ```go\n   812→     func TestWithDatabase(t *testing.T) {\n   813→         db := setupTestDB(t)\n   814→         t.Cleanup(func() {\n   815→             db.Close()\n   816→         })\n   817→         // test logic\n   818→     }\n   819→     ```\n   820→\n   821→4. **Don't rely on test execution order**\n   822→   - Tests should be independent and runnable in any order\n   823→   - Don't assume one test runs before another\n   824→   - Package-level `init()` functions should not depend on test order\n   825→   - Each test should set up its own preconditions\n   826→\n   827→5. **Avoid using `time.Sleep()` for synchronization**\n   828→   - `time.Sleep()` makes tests slow and flaky\n   829→   - Use proper synchronization primitives instead\n   830→   - Example:\n   831→     ```go\n   832→     // BAD: Unreliable timing\n   833→     go doWork()\n   834→     time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n   835→     // hope work is done\n   836→\n   837→     // GOOD: Explicit synchronization\n   838→     done := make(chan bool)\n   839→     go func() {\n   840→         doWork()\n   841→         done <- true\n   842→     }()\n   843→     <-done\n   844→     ```\n   845→\n   846→6. **Don't skip error checks in test code**\n   847→   - Check all errors, even in test setup\n   848→   - Use `t.Fatal()` if setup errors prevent the test from continuing\n   849→   - Example:\n   850→     ```go\n   851→     // BAD\n   852→     data, _ := os.ReadFile(\"testdata/input.json\")\n   853→\n   854→     // GOOD\n   855→     data, err := os.ReadFile(\"testdata/input.json\")\n   856→     if err != nil {\n   857→         t.Fatalf(\"failed to read test file: %v\", err)\n   858→     }\n   859→     ```\n   860→\n   861→7. **Don't use overly complex table-driven tests**\n   862→   - If test cases require extensive setup or have different logic, consider separate test functions\n   863→   - Table-driven tests work best when test cases follow the same pattern\n   864→   - Break up tests when the table becomes hard to read or maintain\n   865→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Focus on testing the public API and observable behavior\n   - Avoid testing private functions directly\n   - Don't rely on specific internal state\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Testing internal state\n     if cache.internalMap[\"key\"] != expected {\n         t.Error(\"internal map mismatch\")\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Testing behavior\n     got := cache.Get(\"key\")\n     if got != expected {\n         t.Errorf(\"Get(key) = %v, want %v\", got, expected)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Unit tests must NEVER have external dependencies**\n   - No network calls (HTTP, gRPC, database connections, etc.)\n   - No real filesystem access (except temporary filesystem when required)\n   - Use mocks or in-memory implementations for external dependencies\n   - Tests with external dependencies are integration tests, not unit tests\n   - Exception: `os.CreateTemp()`, `t.TempDir()` and similar temporary filesystem operations are acceptable\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: External dependency in unit test\n     func TestFetchUser(t *testing.T) {\n         resp, err := http.Get(\"https://api.example.com/user/123\")\n         // ...\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Mock the external dependency\n     func TestFetchUser(t *testing.T) {\n         client := &mockHTTPClient{\n             getFunc: func(url string) (*Response, error) {\n                 return &Response{Status: 200, Body: `{\"id\": 123}`}, nil\n             },\n         }\n         svc := NewService(client)\n         // ...\n     }\n\n     // ACCEPTABLE: Temporary filesystem\n     func TestWriteConfig(t *testing.T) {\n         dir := t.TempDir()\n         configPath := filepath.Join(dir, \"config.json\")\n         // test logic with temporary directory\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Don't test constants or functions with no logic**\n   - Don't write tests for constant values\n   - Don't test trivial constructors that only assign parameters to struct fields\n   - Don't test functions with no logic (simple getters, setters with no validation)\n   - Focus testing efforts on code with actual logic, branching, or transformations\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Testing constants\n     func TestMaxRetries(t *testing.T) {\n         if MaxRetries != 3 {\n             t.Errorf(\"MaxRetries = %d, want 3\", MaxRetries)\n         }\n     }\n\n     // BAD: Testing trivial constructor\n     func TestNewUser(t *testing.T) {\n         user := NewUser(\"John\", 30)\n         if user.Name != \"John\" {\n             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", user.Name, \"John\")\n         }\n         if user.Age != 30 {\n             t.Errorf(\"Age = %d, want %d\", user.Age, 30)\n         }\n     }\n\n     // Where NewUser is just:\n     // func NewUser(name string, age int) User {\n     //     return User{Name: name, Age: age}\n     // }\n\n     // GOOD: Test functions with actual logic\n     func TestValidateUser(t *testing.T) {\n         user := User{Name: \"\", Age: -1}\n         err := user.Validate()\n         if err == nil {\n             t.Error(\"expected validation error for invalid user\")\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Strive for 80% behavioral coverage, not line coverage**\n   - Focus on testing 80% of behaviors and use cases, not 80% of lines executed\n   - Line coverage metrics can be misleading - executing a line doesn't mean the behavior is tested\n   - A single test can execute many lines but only test one behavior\n   - Multiple tests may be needed to cover all behaviors in a single function\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // This function has multiple behaviors to test:\n     func ProcessOrder(order *Order) error {\n         if order == nil {\n             return ErrNilOrder\n         }\n         if order.Total < 0 {\n             return ErrNegativeTotal\n         }\n         if order.Items == nil || len(order.Items) == 0 {\n             return ErrNoItems\n         }\n         // process order\n         return nil\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Test each behavior separately\n     // - Behavior: nil order returns error\n     // - Behavior: negative total returns error\n     // - Behavior: empty items returns error\n     // - Behavior: valid order processes successfully\n     // This is 4 behaviors, and we should test all 4 (100% behavioral coverage)\n\n     // BAD: One test that executes all lines but only tests success case\n     // This would give high line coverage but poor behavioral coverage\n     func TestProcessOrder(t *testing.T) {\n         order := &Order{Total: 100, Items: []Item{{ID: 1}}}\n         err := ProcessOrder(order)\n         if err != nil {\n             t.Errorf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Test Organization\n\n1. **Test files must be named with `_test.go` suffix, matching the source file name**\n   - Pattern: For `foo.go`, create `foo_test.go`\n   - Place test files in the same directory as the code being tested\n   - When splitting tests across multiple files, maintain the prefix: `foo_test.go`, `foo_integration_test.go`, `foo_benchmark_test.go`\n   - Examples: `handler.go` → `handler_test.go`; `user.go` → `user_test.go`, `user_validation_test.go`\n\n2. **Always use the same package name as the code being tested**\n   - Use `package mypackage`, not `package mypackage_test`\n   - This allows tests to access both exported and unexported functions/types\n   - Example: If testing `package handler`, use `package handler` in test files\n\n3. **Name test functions with `Test` prefix followed by the function/feature being tested**\n   - Pattern: `func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T)`\n   - For package-level functions: `func TestValidateEmail(t *testing.T)`\n   - For methods: `func TestUser_Login(t *testing.T)` or `func TestUser_Validate(t *testing.T)`\n     - Use the pattern `TestTypeName_MethodName`\n   - For specific scenarios: `func TestUser_Login_InvalidPassword(t *testing.T)`\n\n4. **Place mocks appropriately based on reusability**\n   - Single-use mocks: Keep inline within the test file where they're used\n   - Large single-use mocks: Extract to `mypkg_mocks_test.go` in the same directory\n   - Reusable mocks: Place in a `mocks` subpackage within the current package\n     - Directory structure: `mypkg/mocks/`\n     - File naming: Match the source file being mocked (e.g., `mypkg/client.go` → `mypkg/mocks/client.go`)\n     - Example: `handler/mocks/storage.go` for mocks of `handler/storage.go`\n\n5. **Place shared test helpers in a `testutils` package at the module root**\n   - Single-use test helpers: Keep inline within the test file or in `mypkg_test_helpers.go`\n   - Shared test helpers used across multiple packages: Place in `testutils` package at module root\n     - Directory structure: `<module-root>/testutils/`\n     - Example: `mymodule/testutils/assertions.go`, `mymodule/testutils/fixtures.go`\n   - Mark helper functions with `t.Helper()` to ensure correct line numbers in error reports\n\n6. **Group related tests in the same file**\n   - All tests for `User.Validate()` should be in the same test file\n   - Split into multiple test files only when a single file becomes unwieldy (>500-1000 lines)\n\n## Test Structure\n\n1. **Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases**\n   - Define test cases as a slice of structs\n   - Each test case should have a `name` field for identification\n   - Example structure:\n     ```go\n     func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {\n         tests := []struct {\n             name string\n             a, b int\n             want int\n         }{\n             {name: \"positive numbers\", a: 2, b: 3, want: 5},\n             {name: \"negative numbers\", a: -1, b: -1, want: -2},\n             {name: \"zero\", a: 0, b: 0, want: 0},\n         }\n         for _, tt := range tests {\n             t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n                 got := Add(tt.a, tt.b)\n                 if got != tt.want {\n                     t.Errorf(\"Add(%d, %d) = %d, want %d\", tt.a, tt.b, got, tt.want)\n                 }\n             })\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Always use subtests with `t.Run()` for table-driven tests**\n   - Allows running individual test cases: `go test -run TestAdd/positive`\n   - Provides clear test output showing which case failed\n   - Enables parallel execution of test cases when appropriate\n\n3. **For complex table-driven tests, extract validation and setup logic**\n   - Add a `validate` function field to the test struct for complex validation instead of inline assertions\n   - If `validate` takes more than 3 arguments, wrap return data in an inline type\n   - Use a `setup()` function for conditional setup instead of adding many fields to the test struct\n     - Exception: Simple tests with uniform setup or only a few toggle fields can skip `setup()`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestComplexOperation(t *testing.T) {\n         type result struct {\n             data   []byte\n             status int\n             meta   map[string]string\n         }\n\n         tests := []struct {\n             name      string\n             input     string\n             setupOpts []SetupOption // instead of: useCache bool, enableRetry bool, timeout int, etc.\n             want      result\n             validate  func(t *testing.T, got result)\n         }{\n             {\n                 name:      \"case1\",\n                 input:     \"...\",\n                 setupOpts: []SetupOption{WithCache(), WithRetry()},\n                 want:      result{...},\n                 validate: func(t *testing.T, got result) {\n                     if got.status != tt.want.status {\n                         t.Errorf(\"status = %d, want %d\", got.status, tt.want.status)\n                     }\n                     // additional complex validation logic\n                 },\n             },\n         }\n\n         for _, tt := range tests {\n             t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n                 svc := setup(t, tt.setupOpts...)\n                 got := svc.Execute(tt.input)\n                 tt.validate(t, got)\n             })\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Use `t.Run()` to separate multiple test cases, even in non-table-driven tests**\n   - When a test function covers multiple scenarios, use subtests for each\n   - Single test case scenarios can omit `t.Run()`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {\n         t.Run(\"create user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n             // test user creation\n         })\n\n         t.Run(\"update user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n             // test user update\n         })\n\n         t.Run(\"delete user\", func(t *testing.T) {\n             // test user deletion\n         })\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**\n   - Arrange: Set up test data and preconditions\n   - Act: Execute the code being tested\n   - Assert: Verify the results\n   - Use blank lines to visually separate these sections\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestUserValidate(t *testing.T) {\n         user := User{Name: \"John\", Email: \"invalid\"}\n         err := user.Validate()\n         if err == nil {\n             t.Error(\"expected validation error, got nil\")\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Keep test cases independent and isolated**\n   - Each test should set up its own data\n   - Avoid shared mutable state between tests\n   - Clean up resources using `t.Cleanup()` or defer\n   - Tests should pass when run individually or as part of the suite\n\n## Test Helpers & Utilities\n\n1. **Use `testify/assert` and `testify/require` for all assertions**\n   - Import `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for assertions that allow the test to continue\n   - Import `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for assertions where the test must stop on failure\n   - `assert` maps to `t.Error()` behavior (test continues)\n   - `require` maps to `t.Fatal()` behavior (test stops immediately)\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     import (\n         \"testing\"\n         \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n         \"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\"\n     )\n\n     func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {\n         // Use require for setup/preconditions that must succeed\n         db, err := setupTestDB()\n         require.NoError(t, err, \"failed to setup test database\")\n         require.NotNil(t, db)\n\n         // Use assert for multiple assertions that should all be checked\n         user := GetUser(db, \"123\")\n         assert.Equal(t, \"John\", user.Name)\n         assert.Equal(t, 30, user.Age)\n         assert.True(t, user.IsActive)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Always use `t.Helper()` in test helper functions**\n   - Mark helper functions with `t.Helper()` as the first line\n   - Ensures error messages point to the calling test, not the helper\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func assertUser(t *testing.T, got, want User) {\n         t.Helper()\n         if got.Name != want.Name {\n             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", got.Name, want.Name)\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `t.Cleanup()` for resource cleanup**\n   - Prefer `t.Cleanup()` over defer for test cleanup\n   - Cleanup functions run in LIFO order after test completion\n   - Works correctly with subtests and parallel tests\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestWithTempFile(t *testing.T) {\n         f, err := os.CreateTemp(\"\", \"test\")\n         if err != nil {\n             t.Fatal(err)\n         }\n         t.Cleanup(func() {\n             os.Remove(f.Name())\n         })\n         // test code\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Create test fixtures in a consistent location**\n   - Place test data files in a `testdata` directory\n   - Go tools ignore `testdata` directories by convention\n   - Structure: `package/testdata/fixture.json`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func loadFixture(t *testing.T, name string) []byte {\n         t.Helper()\n         data, err := os.ReadFile(filepath.Join(\"testdata\", name))\n         if err != nil {\n             t.Fatalf(\"failed to load fixture %s: %v\", name, err)\n         }\n         return data\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Use golden files for complex output validation**\n   - Store expected output in `testdata/*.golden` files\n   - Compare actual output against golden files\n   - Update golden files with `-update` flag pattern\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     var update = flag.Bool(\"update\", false, \"update golden files\")\n\n     func TestRender(t *testing.T) {\n         got := Render(input)\n         golden := filepath.Join(\"testdata\", \"output.golden\")\n\n         if *update {\n             os.WriteFile(golden, got, 0644)\n         }\n\n         want, _ := os.ReadFile(golden)\n         if !bytes.Equal(got, want) {\n             t.Errorf(\"output mismatch\")\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. **Use `t.Fatal()` when the test cannot continue after a failure**\n   - Use `t.Fatal()` or `t.Fatalf()` for setup failures or preconditions\n   - Stops test execution immediately\n   - Example: Failed to create test resources, nil pointer checks\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestProcess(t *testing.T) {\n         f, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n         if err != nil {\n             t.Fatalf(\"failed to open file: %v\", err)\n         }\n         // test continues only if file opened successfully\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use `t.Error()` when the test can continue after a failure**\n   - Use `t.Error()` or `t.Errorf()` for assertion failures\n   - Allows multiple assertions to be checked in a single test run\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestUser(t *testing.T) {\n         user := GetUser()\n         if user.Name != \"John\" {\n             t.Errorf(\"Name = %q, want %q\", user.Name, \"John\")\n         }\n         if user.Age != 30 {\n             t.Errorf(\"Age = %d, want %d\", user.Age, 30)\n         }\n         // both errors will be reported\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Test error values using `errors.Is()` and error types using `errors.As()`**\n   - Use `errors.Is()` to check if an error matches a sentinel error\n   - Use `errors.As()` to check if an error is of a specific type\n   - Don't compare error strings directly\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestValidate(t *testing.T) {\n         err := Validate(input)\n\n         // Check sentinel error\n         if !errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidInput) {\n             t.Errorf(\"expected ErrInvalidInput, got %v\", err)\n         }\n\n         // Check error type\n         var validationErr *ValidationError\n         if !errors.As(err, &validationErr) {\n             t.Errorf(\"expected ValidationError, got %T\", err)\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **When testing for expected errors, verify both presence and type**\n   - Don't just check `err != nil`, verify it's the correct error\n   - Include error details in failure messages\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     tests := []struct {\n         name    string\n         input   string\n         wantErr error\n     }{\n         {name: \"invalid email\", input: \"bad\", wantErr: ErrInvalidEmail},\n         {name: \"valid email\", input: \"test@example.com\", wantErr: nil},\n     }\n\n     for _, tt := range tests {\n         t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n             err := ValidateEmail(tt.input)\n             if !errors.Is(err, tt.wantErr) {\n                 t.Errorf(\"got error %v, want %v\", err, tt.wantErr)\n             }\n         })\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Mocking & Dependencies\n\n1. **All public interfaces must have mocks generated via `moq`**\n   - Generate mocks for all exported interfaces\n   - Place generated mocks in the `mocks` subpackage (see Test Organization rule 4)\n   - Use `go generate` with a generation comment\n   - Prefer `go run` to avoid requiring `moq` to be installed locally\n   - Pin `moq` to a recent version\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // In storage.go\n     package handler\n\n     //go:generate go run github.com/matryer/moq@latest -out mocks/storage.go . Storage\n\n     type Storage interface {\n         Get(id string) (*Item, error)\n         Save(item *Item) error\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Use `moq` for consumed interfaces, except for simple cases**\n   - Generate mocks for external interfaces you depend on\n   - Exception: If testing only 1-2 methods, inline mocks are acceptable\n   - Follow the same `go generate` pattern as public interfaces\n   - Example of acceptable inline mock:\n     ```go\n     type mockStorage struct {\n         getFunc func(id string) (*Item, error)\n     }\n\n     func (m *mockStorage) Get(id string) (*Item, error) {\n         return m.getFunc(id)\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **NEVER mock internal logic or implementation details**\n   - Mocks should ONLY be used to control data returned from external dependencies\n   - Do NOT check that mocks were called with specific parameters\n   - Do NOT count the number of times a mock was called\n   - Do NOT verify the order of mock calls\n   - Invalid example (DO NOT DO THIS):\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Testing implementation details\n     mock.AssertCalled(t, \"Save\", specificItem)\n     mock.AssertNumberOfCalls(t, \"Get\", 3)\n     ```\n\n4. **Use mocks only to provide test data, not to verify behavior**\n   - Valid use: Return test data or errors from external dependencies\n   - Invalid use: Asserting on how the mock was used\n   - Test behavior through observable outputs, not mock interactions\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestUserService_Create(t *testing.T) {\n         // GOOD: Mock returns test data\n         storage := &mockStorage{\n             saveFunc: func(item *Item) error {\n                 return nil // or return an error to test error handling\n             },\n         }\n\n         svc := NewUserService(storage)\n         err := svc.Create(user)\n\n         // GOOD: Assert on the actual result\n         if err != nil {\n             t.Errorf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n         }\n\n         // BAD: Don't assert on mock internals\n         // if !storage.saveCalled { ... }\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Concurrency\n\n1. **Always run tests with the race detector enabled**\n   - Use `go test -race` to detect data races\n   - Run race detector in CI/CD pipelines\n   - Example:\n     ```bash\n     go test -race ./...\n     ```\n\n2. **Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests that can run concurrently**\n   - Mark tests as parallel when they don't share mutable state\n   - Speeds up test execution\n   - Place `t.Parallel()` at the start of the test function\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestUserValidation(t *testing.T) {\n         t.Parallel() // This test can run in parallel with others\n\n         user := User{Name: \"John\"}\n         err := user.Validate()\n         // assertions\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Use synchronization primitives to test goroutines safely**\n   - Use `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for goroutines to complete\n   - Use channels to coordinate and receive results\n   - Don't rely on `time.Sleep()` for synchronization\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestConcurrentWrites(t *testing.T) {\n         var wg sync.WaitGroup\n         cache := NewCache()\n\n         for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n             wg.Add(1)\n             go func(val int) {\n                 defer wg.Done()\n                 cache.Set(fmt.Sprintf(\"key%d\", val), val)\n             }(i)\n         }\n\n         wg.Wait()\n         // assertions\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Test timeout scenarios using contexts with deadlines**\n   - Use `context.WithTimeout()` or `context.WithDeadline()` for timeout tests\n   - Verify that operations respect context cancellation\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestOperation_Timeout(t *testing.T) {\n         ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Millisecond)\n         defer cancel()\n\n         err := LongRunningOperation(ctx)\n\n         if !errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) {\n             t.Errorf(\"expected context.DeadlineExceeded, got %v\", err)\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Use channels with timeouts to prevent test hangs**\n   - When testing goroutines that send results via channels, always use timeouts\n   - Prevents tests from hanging indefinitely if goroutines fail\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestAsyncOperation(t *testing.T) {\n         result := make(chan string, 1)\n\n         go func() {\n             result <- PerformOperation()\n         }()\n\n         select {\n         case got := <-result:\n             if got != \"expected\" {\n                 t.Errorf(\"got %q, want %q\", got, \"expected\")\n             }\n         case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):\n             t.Fatal(\"test timed out waiting for result\")\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Integration Testing\n\n1. **Integration tests must always be behind a build flag**\n   - Use build tags to separate integration tests from unit tests\n   - Prevents integration tests from running by default with `go test ./...`\n   - Run integration tests explicitly with `go test -tags=integration ./...`\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     //go:build integration\n     // +build integration\n\n     package mypackage\n\n     import \"testing\"\n\n     func TestDatabaseIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n         // integration test code\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Integration tests must NEVER rely on services running outside the user's machine**\n   - All external dependencies must be managed within the test\n   - Don't assume databases, APIs, or other services are already running\n   - Don't rely on shared test environments or infrastructure\n   - Tests should be fully self-contained and reproducible\n\n3. **Use `testcontainers` for spinning up real service instances**\n   - Prefer `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go` for most external services\n   - Provides real instances of databases, message queues, caches, etc.\n   - Tests run against actual service implementations, not mocks\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     //go:build integration\n     // +build integration\n\n     package mypackage\n\n     import (\n         \"context\"\n         \"testing\"\n         \"github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go\"\n         \"github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/wait\"\n     )\n\n     func TestWithPostgres(t *testing.T) {\n         ctx := context.Background()\n\n         req := testcontainers.ContainerRequest{\n             Image:        \"postgres:15\",\n             ExposedPorts: []string{\"5432/tcp\"},\n             Env: map[string]string{\n                 \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD\": \"test\",\n                 \"POSTGRES_DB\":       \"testdb\",\n             },\n             WaitingFor: wait.ForLog(\"database system is ready to accept connections\"),\n         }\n\n         container, err := testcontainers.GenericContainer(ctx, testcontainers.GenericContainerRequest{\n             ContainerRequest: req,\n             Started:          true,\n         })\n         require.NoError(t, err)\n         t.Cleanup(func() {\n             container.Terminate(ctx)\n         })\n\n         // Get connection details and run tests\n         host, _ := container.Host(ctx)\n         port, _ := container.MappedPort(ctx, \"5432\")\n         // test logic\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **For services incompatible with `testcontainers`, use docker-compose**\n   - Create `docker-compose.test.yml` files to define the test environment\n   - Use environment variables for configuration (ports, passwords, hostnames)\n   - Document the docker-compose setup in test file comments or README\n   - Example docker-compose.test.yml:\n     ```yaml\n     version: '3.8'\n     services:\n       redis:\n         image: redis:7\n         ports:\n           - \"${REDIS_PORT:-6379}:6379\"\n       postgres:\n         image: postgres:15\n         environment:\n           POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-testpass}\n           POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-testdb}\n         ports:\n           - \"${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432\"\n     ```\n   - Example test:\n     ```go\n     //go:build integration\n     // +build integration\n\n     func TestWithDockerCompose(t *testing.T) {\n         // Read config from environment variables\n         redisAddr := fmt.Sprintf(\"localhost:%s\", getEnv(\"REDIS_PORT\", \"6379\"))\n         pgHost := getEnv(\"POSTGRES_HOST\", \"localhost\")\n         pgPort := getEnv(\"POSTGRES_PORT\", \"5432\")\n\n         // test logic using these connection details\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **In-process HTTP test servers are NOT valid integration tests**\n   - Using `httptest.Server` to mock external APIs is NOT an integration test\n   - In-process mocks only test your ability to emulate a service, not the actual service behavior\n   - Integration tests must use real service instances (via testcontainers or docker-compose)\n   - Example of what NOT to do:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: This is NOT an integration test, it's a unit test with a mock\n     func TestAPIIntegration(t *testing.T) {\n         server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n             w.WriteHeader(200)\n             w.Write([]byte(`{\"status\": \"ok\"}`))\n         }))\n         defer server.Close()\n\n         // This only tests that you can parse your own mock response\n         // It does NOT test integration with the real API\n     }\n     ```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Don't use `panic()` in tests**\n   - Use `t.Fatal()` or `t.Fatalf()` instead of `panic()`\n   - `panic()` stops the entire test suite, not just the current test\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     if err != nil {\n         panic(err)\n     }\n\n     // GOOD\n     if err != nil {\n         t.Fatalf(\"unexpected error: %v\", err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Avoid global state and shared mutable variables**\n   - Global variables can cause flaky tests and race conditions\n   - Tests can interfere with each other when modifying shared state\n   - Each test should create its own isolated data\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Global shared state\n     var testCache = make(map[string]string)\n\n     func TestA(t *testing.T) {\n         testCache[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n         // test logic\n     }\n\n     // GOOD: Isolated state per test\n     func TestA(t *testing.T) {\n         cache := make(map[string]string)\n         cache[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n         // test logic\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Don't ignore test cleanup**\n   - Always clean up resources (files, network connections, databases)\n   - Use `t.Cleanup()` or `defer` to ensure cleanup happens\n   - Leaked resources can cause subsequent tests to fail\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     func TestWithDatabase(t *testing.T) {\n         db := setupTestDB(t)\n         t.Cleanup(func() {\n             db.Close()\n         })\n         // test logic\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Don't rely on test execution order**\n   - Tests should be independent and runnable in any order\n   - Don't assume one test runs before another\n   - Package-level `init()` functions should not depend on test order\n   - Each test should set up its own preconditions\n\n5. **Avoid using `time.Sleep()` for synchronization**\n   - `time.Sleep()` makes tests slow and flaky\n   - Use proper synchronization primitives instead\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD: Unreliable timing\n     go doWork()\n     time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n     // hope work is done\n\n     // GOOD: Explicit synchronization\n     done := make(chan bool)\n     go func() {\n         doWork()\n         done <- true\n     }()\n     <-done\n     ```\n\n6. **Don't skip error checks in test code**\n   - Check all errors, even in test setup\n   - Use `t.Fatal()` if setup errors prevent the test from continuing\n   - Example:\n     ```go\n     // BAD\n     data, _ := os.ReadFile(\"testdata/input.json\")\n\n     // GOOD\n     data, err := os.ReadFile(\"testdata/input.json\")\n     if err != nil {\n         t.Fatalf(\"failed to read test file: %v\", err)\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Don't use overly complex table-driven tests**\n   - If test cases require extensive setup or have different logic, consider separate test functions\n   - Table-driven tests work best when test cases follow the same pattern\n   - Break up tests when the table becomes hard to read or maintain\n","numLines":865,"startLine":1,"totalLines":865}}}

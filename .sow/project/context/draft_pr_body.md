# SDK Branching Support (AddBranch API)

## Intent

This PR implements a declarative API for state-determined branching in the sow project SDK. The `AddBranch()` method extends the existing fluent builder pattern to allow project type developers to define branching logic explicitly through discriminator functions and branch paths, replacing the current workaround of hidden logic in OnAdvance determiners.

## Status

🚧 **Draft** - Implementation in progress

## Progress

- [x] Planning phase
- [ ] Implementation phase

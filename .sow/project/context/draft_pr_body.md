# libs/schemas module

## Intent

Create a new standalone `libs/schemas` Go module containing all CUE schemas and generated Go types for the sow project. This migrates schemas from `cli/schemas/` to `libs/schemas/`, enabling reuse outside the CLI and establishing a clean foundation package with no internal dependencies.

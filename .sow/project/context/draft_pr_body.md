# libs/exec module

## Intent

Create a new `libs/exec` Go module providing a clean command execution abstraction using the ports and adapters pattern. This moves `cli/internal/exec/` to `libs/exec/` as a standalone, reusable module with a well-designed interface, generated mocks via moq, and full standards compliance.

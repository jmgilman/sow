  description: |
    Establish the basic file structure, schemas, and version management system
    for the sow framework. This is Milestone 1 from ROADMAP.md.

    Key deliverables:
    - Define two-layer architecture (execution + data layers)
    - Create file structure templates for plugin/ and .sow/ directories
    - Implement version tracking system
    - Define YAML/JSON schemas for all state files
    - Create basic validation utilities

  complexity:
    rating: 2
    metrics:
      estimated_files: 20
      cross_cutting: true
      new_dependencies: false
      rationale: |
        Architectural foundation work requiring design decisions and multiple
        template files. Moderate complexity due to establishing patterns that
        will be used throughout the entire system.

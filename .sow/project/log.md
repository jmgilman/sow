**Result**: success

Created project 'milestone-1-foundation' for Milestone 1: Foundation and Core Infrastructure.

Project assessment:
- Complexity: Simple (1) - Implementing documented designs
- Architecture and schemas already fully defined in docs/
- Main work: Create plugin/ directory structure and populate with agents/commands
- Initial phase: implement (5 tasks)

Key deliverables:
1. Create plugin/ directory structure (becomes .claude/ on install)
2. Populate plugin with all agent definitions (orchestrator, architect, implementer, integration-tester, reviewer, documenter)
3. Create plugin metadata (.claude-plugin/plugin.json, .plugin-version)
4. Initialize .sow/ data layer structure
5. Create version tracking file (.sow/.version)

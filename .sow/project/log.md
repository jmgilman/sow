Created project 'milestone-1-foundation' for ROADMAP.md Milestone 1.

Initial plan:
- Phase: design (3 tasks)
  - 010: Design file structure for plugin/ directory (execution layer)
  - 020: Design file structure for .sow/ directory (data layer)
  - 030: Define YAML schemas for all state files

- Phase: implement (4 tasks)
  - 010: Create plugin/ template files and directories
  - 020: Create .sow/ template files and directories
  - 030: Implement version tracking files
  - 040: Create basic validation utilities

Complexity: 2/3 (Moderate) - architectural foundation requiring design decisions
and multiple template files. Establishes patterns for entire system.

Following progressive planning philosophy: Starting with 2 phases (design, implement).
Will add test/review/document phases if needed as work progresses.

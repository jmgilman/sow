Fixed finalize phase Complete() method to be state-aware and fire appropriate transition events (EventDocumentationDone, EventChecksDone) based on current state. This enables proper progression through FinalizeDocumentation → FinalizeChecks → FinalizeDelete states.

action: bug_fixes
result: success
files:
  - cli/internal/project/standard/finalize.go
  - cli/internal/project/loader/loader.go
---

Fixed two bugs discovered during finalize phase: (1) FinalizePhase.Complete() now properly fires state transition events (EventDocumentationDone, EventChecksDone) to progress through finalize sub-states. (2) loader.Delete() now sets the typed Project_deleted field instead of metadata, allowing the ProjectDeleted guard to work correctly. All tests and linters passing.

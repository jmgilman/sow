**Action**: project-created

Created project "cli-foundation-and-schemas" on branch feat/cli-and-schemas with complexity rating 3.

**Phases**:
- design (3 tasks)
- implement (5 tasks)

**Rationale**: Starting from scratch with Go CLI implementation. Need design phase to convert templates to CUE schemas and plan architecture before implementation.

**Action**: task-completed

Completed task design/030: "Define build and distribution strategy for cross-platform binaries"

**Agent**: architect-1 (iteration 1)

**Outcome**: Created comprehensive ADR with GoReleaser-based build strategy, GitHub Actions automation, installation methods, and version alignment strategy. All configuration files ready for implementation.

---

## 2025-10-13T00:21:00Z - orchestrator-1

**Action**: phase-completed

Completed design phase with all 3 tasks finished.

**Tasks Completed**:
- design/010: CUE schemas with validation rules
- design/020: CLI architecture (ADR 001)
- design/030: Build and distribution strategy (ADR 002)

**Outcome**: All architectural decisions documented. Moving to implement phase.

## 2025-10-13T00:22:00Z - orchestrator-1

**Action**: task-started

Starting task implement/010: "Set up Go project structure with CUE embedding"

**Agent**: implementer-1 (iteration 1)

**Context**: Providing ADR 001 (CLI architecture) and CUE schemas for Go project initialization.

---

## 2025-10-13T01:00:00Z - orchestrator-1

**Action**: task-completed

Completed task implement/010: "Set up Go project structure with CUE embedding"

**Agent**: implementer-1 (iteration 1)

**Outcome**: Successfully initialized Go project with Cobra CLI framework, embedded CUE schemas, created root and version commands. Binary builds and all tests pass. Foundation ready for remaining CLI commands.

---

## 2025-10-13T01:01:00Z - orchestrator-1

**Action**: task-started

Starting task implement/020: "Implement core validation engine (CUE schema validation)"

**Agent**: implementer-1 (iteration 1)

**Context**: Providing CUE schemas and template files for validation engine implementation. This is the core validation system that all CLI commands will use.

---

## 2025-10-13T00:35:00Z - orchestrator-1

**Action**: task-completed

Completed task implement/020: "Implement core validation engine (CUE schema validation)"

**Agent**: implementer-1 (iteration 1)

**Outcome**: Successfully implemented validation engine with CUE-based validation for all 5 file types. All tests pass (83.8% coverage), performance verified at 188Âµs average (well under 1s requirement). Clear error messages with field-level details. Schema caching for performance.

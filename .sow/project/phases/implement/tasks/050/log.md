## 2025-10-14T01:31:00Z - Started Task

**Action**: started_task
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Read task requirements and architecture documentation. Understand that we need to:
1. Implement `sow sinks` command with 4 subcommands (install, update, list, remove)
2. Implement `sow repos` command with 4 subcommands (add, sync, list, remove)
3. Create internal packages for sink and repo management
4. Use TDD approach throughout

**Files Read**:
- `.sow/project/phases/implement/tasks/050/state.yaml`
- `.sow/project/phases/implement/tasks/050/description.md`
- `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `internal/schema/cue/sink-index.cue`

## 2025-10-14T02:00:00Z - Created Sinks Package

**Action**: created_file
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Created `internal/sinks` package with TDD approach:
- Wrote comprehensive tests in `sinks_test.go` covering index loading/saving, sink management, URL extraction
- Implemented `sinks.go` with Index struct, Load/Save methods, AddSink/RemoveSink/FindSink operations
- All tests pass with >90% coverage

**Files Created**:
- `internal/sinks/sinks_test.go`
- `internal/sinks/sinks.go`

## 2025-10-14T02:15:00Z - Created Repos Package

**Action**: created_file
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Created `internal/repos` package following same TDD pattern:
- Wrote comprehensive tests in `repos_test.go` covering repository index operations
- Implemented `repos.go` with support for both clone and symlink types
- All tests pass

**Files Created**:
- `internal/repos/repos_test.go`
- `internal/repos/repos.go`

## 2025-10-14T02:30:00Z - Implemented Sinks Commands

**Action**: created_file
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Implemented `sow sinks` command with all subcommands:
- `sinks install` - Clone git repos with shallow depth, auto-extract name from URL
- `sinks update` - Pull latest changes for git-based sinks
- `sinks list` - Display all installed sinks with metadata
- `sinks remove` - Remove sink directory and update index
- Wrote comprehensive tests covering success and error cases
- All tests pass

**Files Created**:
- `internal/commands/sinks.go`
- `internal/commands/sinks_test.go`

**Features**:
- Git clone with `--depth 1` for performance
- Auto-name extraction from URLs
- Support for local path copying
- Index management with JSON persistence
- Error handling for network/permission issues

## 2025-10-14T02:45:00Z - Implemented Repos Commands

**Action**: created_file
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Implemented `sow repos` command with all subcommands:
- `repos add` - Clone repos or create symlinks with `--symlink` flag
- `repos sync` - Pull latest changes for cloned repos
- `repos list` - Display linked repositories with type info
- `repos remove` - Remove repo directory/symlink and update index
- Wrote comprehensive tests
- All tests pass

**Files Created**:
- `internal/commands/repos.go`
- `internal/commands/repos_test.go`

**Features**:
- Support for both git clones and symlinks
- Branch tracking for cloned repos
- Selective sync (one repo or all)
- Type-aware operations (skip symlinks in sync)

## 2025-10-14T02:50:00Z - Integrated Commands into CLI

**Action**: modified_file
**Result**: success
**Agent**: implementer-1

Added sinks and repos commands to root command:
- Registered `NewSinksCmd()` and `NewReposCmd()` in root
- Built and tested binary - all commands work correctly
- Help text displays properly for all subcommands

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/commands/root.go`

**Verification**:
- Built binary successfully
- `sow sinks --help` works
- `sow repos --help` works
- `sow sinks list` works (returns empty state)
- All unit tests pass (sinks, repos, commands)

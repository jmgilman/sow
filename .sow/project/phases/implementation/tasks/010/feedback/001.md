# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed creation of libs/schemas Go module with:
- Directory structure: libs/schemas/, libs/schemas/cue.mod/, libs/schemas/project/
- go.mod with correct module path and Go version (1.25.3)
- cue.mod/module.cue with CUE language version v0.13.2
- embed.go with go:generate directive and embed pattern
- All 6 CUE schema files copied from cli/schemas/
- cue_types_gen.go generated with all 15 expected types
- project/.gitkeep.cue placeholder for embed pattern

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria have been met:
1. libs/schemas/ directory exists with all required files
2. go.mod declares correct module path `github.com/jmgilman/sow/libs/schemas`
3. cue.mod/module.cue declares CUE module with correct path and version
4. All 6 CUE files copied without modification
5. embed.go correctly embeds CUE files with proper pattern
6. cue_types_gen.go generated with all required types
7. go build ./... succeeds
8. go mod tidy produces clean go.mod

The gitkeep.cue placeholder in project/ is a good solution to ensure the embed pattern `project/*.cue` works before the project schemas are migrated.

## Next Steps
Task complete, proceeding to task 020 (migrate project schemas).

# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed implementation of Task 010: Add file selection state and discovery helper.

**Key changes:**
- Added `StateFileSelect` constant to `wizard_state.go`
- Implemented `discoverKnowledgeFiles()` helper function in `wizard_helpers.go`
- Updated `validateStateTransition()` to include new state transitions
- Added comprehensive test coverage (9 test cases for file discovery, 8 for state transitions)
- Updated existing integration tests to reflect new state flow

**Modified files:**
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state.go`
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_helpers.go`
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_helpers_test.go`
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_integration_test.go`

**Test results:**
- All new tests pass (17 test cases)
- All existing tests continue to pass
- TDD methodology followed correctly

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation following TDD methodology:

**Strengths:**
- State constant properly placed between `StateNameEntry` and `StatePromptEntry`
- `discoverKnowledgeFiles()` implementation is clean and handles all edge cases correctly:
  - Gracefully handles non-existent directories (returns empty slice, not error)
  - Properly handles empty directories
  - Returns relative paths as specified
  - Sorts results alphabetically
  - Includes comprehensive godoc comments with examples
- State transition updates are correct for both regular and GitHub issue flows
- Test coverage is comprehensive and follows existing patterns
- All acceptance criteria met

**Code Quality:**
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Error handling uses proper wrapping with `fmt.Errorf`
- Comments are clear and helpful
- No linting errors

## Next Steps

Task complete. Ready to proceed to Task 020 (Implement file selection handler screen).

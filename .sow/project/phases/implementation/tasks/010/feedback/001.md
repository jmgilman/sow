# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the executor interface implementation:
- `executor.go` - Executor and CommandRunner interfaces, DefaultCommandRunner
- `executor_mock.go` - MockExecutor and MockCommandRunner with function fields
- `executor_test.go` - Comprehensive tests for interface compliance and mock behavior

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation that meets all acceptance criteria:

1. **Executor interface** correctly defined with Name(), Spawn(), Resume(), SupportsResumption()
2. **CommandRunner interface** provides clean abstraction for subprocess execution
3. **DefaultCommandRunner** properly connects stdin/stdout/stderr
4. **MockExecutor** follows the function field pattern from exec/mock.go
5. **MockCommandRunner** captures call parameters (LastName, LastArgs, LastStdin) for verification
6. **Compile-time interface checks** included for all implementations
7. **Comprehensive godoc** explaining design rationale

All 35 tests pass. The implementation follows existing codebase patterns and provides a solid foundation for the executor implementations.

## Next Steps

Task complete, moving on to tasks that depend on this interface.

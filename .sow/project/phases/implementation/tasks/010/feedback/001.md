# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Task 010 implementation reviewed. The implementer successfully added branch name validation and uncommitted changes checking following strict TDD methodology.

**Files modified:**
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_helpers.go` - Added 5 functions (169 lines)
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_helpers_test.go` - Added 6 test functions with 28 test cases

**Functions implemented:**
1. `isProtectedBranch()` - Helper to check main/master
2. Enhanced `isValidBranchName()` - Added protected branch check and whitespace trimming
3. `validateProjectName()` - Validates user input with normalization
4. `shouldCheckUncommittedChanges()` - Conditional check logic
5. `performUncommittedChangesCheckIfNeeded()` - Enhanced error messages with 3-part pattern

**Test coverage:** 28 comprehensive test cases covering all functions, edge cases, and error messages.

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

The implementation is excellent and meets all requirements:

**Strengths:**
- ✓ TDD approach followed rigorously (tests written first, confirmed failures, then implementation)
- ✓ All 28 test cases pass, including existing tests (no regressions)
- ✓ Clear, comprehensive godoc comments on all functions
- ✓ Error messages follow 3-part pattern (what/how/next)
- ✓ Enhanced error message in `performUncommittedChangesCheckIfNeeded()` is user-friendly and actionable
- ✓ Protected branch validation properly integrated into existing `isValidBranchName()`
- ✓ Conditional logic in `shouldCheckUncommittedChanges()` is correct
- ✓ Code style consistent with existing codebase
- ✓ No external dependencies added
- ✓ All acceptance criteria from description.md met

**Specific highlights:**
- The table-driven test approach provides excellent coverage
- Enhanced `isValidBranchName()` maintains backward compatibility while adding new validation
- Error message in `performUncommittedChangesCheckIfNeeded()` includes current branch name and specific fix commands
- Conditional logic correctly identifies when validation is needed vs. skippable

**Code quality:**
- Functions are focused and single-purpose
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Documentation includes usage examples
- Test cases cover both success and failure paths

## Next Steps

Task complete. Moving to next task (020 - State Validation).

The validation functions are ready for integration into the wizard flows.

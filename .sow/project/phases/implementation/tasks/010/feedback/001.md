# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed Task 010: GitHub CLI Validation and Error Handling

**Files Modified:**
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state.go` - Added GitHub client integration and validation logic
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state_test.go` - Added 4 comprehensive tests with mock GitHub client

**Key Changes:**
- Added `GitHubClient` interface for testability
- Integrated GitHub client into Wizard struct and initialization
- Implemented `handleIssueSelect()` with GitHub CLI validation
- Implemented `handleGitHubError()` with platform-specific error messages
- Created `mockGitHub` test double for testing
- Added 4 new tests covering all validation scenarios

**Test Results:**
- All 48 tests in cmd/project package pass
- 4 new tests added:
  - TestNewWizard_InitializesGitHubClient
  - TestHandleIssueSelect_GitHubNotInstalled
  - TestHandleIssueSelect_GitHubNotAuthenticated
  - TestHandleIssueSelect_ValidationSuccess

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation! All acceptance criteria have been met:

✓ **GitHub Client Integration**: Properly initialized in `NewWizard()` using local gh executor
✓ **Validation Logic**: Runs `github.Ensure()` when user selects "From GitHub issue"
✓ **Error Handling**: Clear, helpful error messages for:
  - gh not installed (with macOS and Linux installation instructions)
  - gh not authenticated (with `gh auth login` command)
  - Generic GitHub errors (fallback message)
✓ **User-Friendly Fallback**: All errors suggest "From branch name" alternative
✓ **State Management**: Returns to `StateCreateSource` (not cancelled) so user can choose different path
✓ **Success Path**: Validates successfully and transitions to `StateComplete` (ready for Task 020 to extend)
✓ **TDD Approach**: Tests written first, implementation followed
✓ **Interface Design**: `GitHubClient` interface enables clean mocking in tests
✓ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing tests still pass

The code is clean, well-structured, and follows existing patterns in the codebase. The error messages are clear and actionable. The implementation properly sets up the foundation for Task 020 to build upon.

## Next Steps

Task complete. Proceeding to commit changes and move to Task 020.

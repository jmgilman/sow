# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed implementation of Agent struct and standard agent definitions:
- `cli/internal/agents/agents.go` - Core Agent struct and 6 standard agents
- `cli/internal/agents/agents_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite (8 test functions)

Key changes:
- Agent struct with 4 fields: Name, Description, Capabilities, PromptPath
- 6 package-level agent variables: Implementer, Architect, Reviewer, Planner, Researcher, Decomposer
- StandardAgents() function returning all agents
- Thorough test coverage including table-driven tests

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

All acceptance criteria met:
1. Package created at `cli/internal/agents/` with `agents.go`
2. Agent struct defined with all four fields
3. 6 standard agents defined as package-level pointer variables
4. StandardAgents() returns all 6 agents
5. Comprehensive unit tests verify all requirements
6. Code follows project conventions (package comment, Godoc, table-driven tests)

Code quality highlights:
- Excellent package-level documentation explaining purpose and usage
- Clear Godoc comments on all exported types and functions
- Well-structured tests with good coverage of edge cases
- Agent descriptions and capabilities pulled from existing `.claude/agents/` definitions

## Next Steps

Task complete, moving to task 020 (Agent Registry Implementation).

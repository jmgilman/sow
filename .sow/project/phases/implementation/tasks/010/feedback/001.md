# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the complete implementation of Task 010: Core Structure and Constants. The implementer created the foundational package structure at `cli/internal/projects/design/` with all required components:

**Files Created:**
- `states.go` - Three state constants (Active, Finalizing, Completed)
- `events.go` - Two event constants (EventCompleteDesign, EventCompleteFinalization)
- `metadata.go` - Embeds both CUE schemas
- `cue/design_metadata.cue` - Empty schema for design phase flexibility
- `cue/finalization_metadata.cue` - Schema with optional pr_url and project_deleted fields

**Tests Created:**
- `states_test.go` - 4 test cases validating state constants
- `events_test.go` - 4 test cases validating event constants
- `metadata_test.go` - 5 test cases validating embedded CUE schemas

**Test Results:**
- All 12 tests pass
- go vet: clean
- Test coverage: comprehensive

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

The implementation is excellent and meets all acceptance criteria:

✅ **Package Structure**: Correctly created at `cli/internal/projects/design/` with proper subdirectory structure

✅ **State Constants**: All three states properly defined using `state.State` type alias
- Active, Finalizing, Completed
- Clear documentation for each state
- Follows exploration project pattern

✅ **Event Constants**: Both events properly defined using `state.Event` type alias
- EventCompleteDesign, EventCompleteFinalization
- Clear documentation explaining when events fire
- Correct snake_case values for event strings

✅ **CUE Metadata Schemas**:
- Design schema: Empty/flexible as specified
- Finalization schema: Optional pr_url and project_deleted fields
- Both schemas have valid CUE syntax
- Properly embedded via go:embed directives

✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive TDD approach
- Type validation tests
- Value validation tests
- Uniqueness tests
- Naming convention tests
- CUE syntax validation tests
- All tests well-structured with table-driven approach

✅ **Code Quality**:
- Package documentation present
- Clear comments on all constants
- Follows Go naming conventions
- Passes go vet and linting

**Strengths:**
- True TDD approach (tests written first)
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- Clean, well-documented code
- Follows established patterns from exploration project
- CUE schemas correctly structured

## Next Steps

Task 010 is complete. This provides a solid foundation for:
- Task 020: Guard Functions and Helpers (can use these states/events)
- Task 030: Prompt Templates (can reference states)
- Task 040: SDK Integration (will assemble these components)

Proceeding to Task 020.

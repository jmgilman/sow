- go mod tidy completed without errors
- All existing tests pass

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent work! All acceptance criteria have been met:

✓ go.mod contains huh library with version
✓ go.mod contains spinner subpackage
✓ go.sum properly updated with checksums
✓ go mod tidy runs clean
✓ No dependency conflicts
✓ Verification test created and passes
✓ All existing tests still pass

The verification test is well-designed - it not only imports the packages but also verifies the basic constructors work correctly. This ensures the dependencies remain in go.mod and aren't removed by automated tooling.

The huh foundation is now in place for building the interactive wizard UI.

## Next Steps

Task complete. Ready to proceed to Task 020: Extract Shared Utilities.

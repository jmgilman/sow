# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of parent config command:
- Created `cli/cmd/config/config.go` with `NewConfigCmd()` function
- Created `cli/cmd/config/config_test.go` with 6 test cases
- Modified `cli/cmd/root.go` to import and register the config command

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
Implementation correctly follows existing patterns from refs.go and project.go:
- Uses `NewConfigCmd()` as exported constructor (matches naming convention)
- Long description is informative with platform-specific paths
- Lists all planned subcommands in help text
- Tests cover structure, descriptions, error-free execution, and help output
- All 6 tests pass

Root integration is correct:
- Added import `github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/cmd/config`
- Added `config.NewConfigCmd()` in same pattern as other commands

## Next Steps
Task complete, moving to next task (020 - Config init command).

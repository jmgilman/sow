# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the CUE schema implementation for `.sow-ref.yaml` manifest:
- Created `libs/schemas/ref_manifest.cue` with all required type definitions
- Generated Go types via `go generate`
- Created comprehensive test file with 42 test cases
- All tests pass, linting passes with 0 issues

Files modified:
- `libs/schemas/ref_manifest.cue` (new)
- `libs/schemas/ref_manifest_test.go` (new)
- `libs/schemas/cue_types_gen.go` (updated)

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation following TDD approach. The schema:
- Correctly defines all required types (#RefManifest, #RefIdentification, #RefContent, etc.)
- Uses proper regex constraints for semver and kebab-case link
- Includes all 11 classification types as enum
- Follows existing codebase patterns for optional fields and list constraints
- Generated Go types are properly structured with json tags

Tests comprehensively cover schema existence, type lookup, valid manifests, and invalid input validation.

## Next Steps

Task complete. Moving to task 020 (validation function and tests).

# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of the agent command package with list subcommand:
- `cli/cmd/agent/agent.go` - Parent command with NewAgentCmd()
- `cli/cmd/agent/agent_test.go` - 4 tests for parent command structure
- `cli/cmd/agent/list.go` - List subcommand with newListCmd() and runList()
- `cli/cmd/agent/list_test.go` - 7 tests for list subcommand
- `cli/cmd/root.go` - Added agent command registration

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:
- Parent command follows established patterns from config.go and refs.go
- List subcommand properly uses AgentRegistry and sorts alphabetically
- Output uses cmd.Print* methods for testability
- All 11 tests pass
- Functional verification successful: `sow agent list` outputs all 6 agents sorted alphabetically
- Root command integration complete with proper import and registration

Code quality is good - follows existing patterns, proper error handling, clear documentation.

## Next Steps
Task complete, moving to task 020 (Spawn Command).

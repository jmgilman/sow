# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed the following outputs:
- `libs/exec/go.mod` - Module definition with correct path and Go version
- `libs/exec/executor.go` - Executor interface with 6 methods and comprehensive documentation
- `libs/exec/doc.go` - Package documentation with usage examples
- `libs/exec/README.md` - README following READMES.md standard

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:

1. Module structure is correct with `github.com/jmgilman/sow/libs/exec` module path
2. Go version 1.25.3 matches libs/schemas
3. Executor interface has all 6 required methods with proper doc comments
4. Interface design is minimal and matches the existing implementation
5. doc.go provides comprehensive package documentation
6. README.md follows the READMES.md standard with Overview, Quick Start, Usage, and Testing sections
7. Build and lint verification passed per log.md

**Minor note:** The `//go:generate` directive in doc.go uses `mockgen` instead of `moq`. However, task 030 is specifically about mock generation, so this will be addressed there. The directive can be updated when implementing mock generation.

## Next Steps
Task complete. Proceeding to task 020 (LocalExecutor implementation).

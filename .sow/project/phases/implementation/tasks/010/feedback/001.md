# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Task 010 successfully implemented transition descriptions with the `WithDescription` option function. The implementation followed TDD principles strictly and includes comprehensive test coverage.

**Modified Files:**
- `cli/internal/sdks/project/config.go` - Added `description` field to TransitionConfig
- `cli/internal/sdks/project/options.go` - Implemented WithDescription() option function
- `cli/internal/sdks/project/options_test.go` - Added TestWithDescription with 3 subtests
- `cli/internal/sdks/project/builder_test.go` - Added integration test

**Tests Added:**
- Unit tests: TestWithDescription (3 subtests covering basic usage, chaining, and empty descriptions)
- Integration test: Verification in TestAddTransition that description is stored correctly
- All tests pass with no breaking changes

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent work! The implementation is clean, well-tested, and follows all existing SDK patterns:

**Strengths:**
1. Strict TDD approach - tests written first, verified to fail, then implementation
2. Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases (empty descriptions)
3. Integration test ensures AddTransition properly stores descriptions
4. Clear godoc comments with usage examples
5. Follows existing option function pattern perfectly
6. No breaking changes - all existing tests pass

**Code Quality:**
- Description field properly documented with context-specific note
- WithDescription function includes detailed godoc with best practices
- Tests cover all acceptance criteria

**Bonus:** Also added TestWithFailedPhase for an existing function that was missing tests - good proactive work!

All acceptance criteria from the task description have been met. This provides the solid foundation needed for the AddBranch API implementation in subsequent tasks.

## Next Steps

Task complete, moving on to task 020 (Branch Data Structures).

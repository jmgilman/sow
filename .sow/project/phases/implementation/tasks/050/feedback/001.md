# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the mocks generation and README implementation:

**Files created:**
- `libs/git/mocks/client.go` - Generated mock via moq (GitHubClientMock)
- `libs/git/mocks/client_test.go` - Mock verification tests (10 tests)
- `libs/git/README.md` - Package documentation following READMES.md

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

All acceptance criteria met:

1. ✅ Mock generated: Using go:generate directive with moq
2. ✅ Mock compiles: No build errors
3. ✅ Mock implements interface: Compile-time verification test passes
4. ✅ All 9 methods have corresponding Funcs: CheckAvailabilityFunc, ListIssuesFunc, etc.
5. ✅ README exists: At libs/git/README.md
6. ✅ Quick Start section: Shows basic Git and GitHub usage
7. ✅ Usage section: Git, GitHub, Worktree, and Testing with Mocks examples
8. ✅ Troubleshooting section: Common issues and solutions
9. ✅ Examples compile: Code samples are valid Go
10. ✅ All tests pass: 10 mock tests + all existing tests

README follows READMES.md standard:
- Overview (1-3 sentences)
- Quick Start (copy-paste example)
- Usage (detailed sections)
- Troubleshooting (common issues)
- Links (godoc reference)

## Next Steps

Task complete. Moving to task 060 (update consumer files).

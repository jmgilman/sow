# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed task 050: Command Integration and Cleanup

**Files Created:**
- `cli/cmd/project/project_test.go` (159 lines) - Comprehensive command structure tests

**Files Modified:**
- `cli/cmd/project/project.go` - Wizard integrated as main command (reduced from 38 to 31 lines)

**Files Deleted:**
- `cli/cmd/project/new.go` (328 lines removed)
- `cli/cmd/project/continue.go` (166 lines removed)

**Net Change:** -336 lines of code with cleaner architecture

**Key Changes:**
1. Wizard is now the primary `sow project` command (RunE: runWizard)
2. Old `new`, `continue`, and `wizard` subcommands removed
3. `set` and `delete` subcommands preserved
4. Updated documentation and help text
5. Comprehensive test coverage added (5 new tests)

**Test Results:**
- All 5 new tests passing
- All existing tests still passing (31 total tests in cmd/project)
- No compilation errors or warnings
- CLI builds successfully

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent cleanup and integration! All acceptance criteria met:

✓ Wizard integrated as main `sow project` command
✓ RunE points to runWizard function
✓ Args validator added (NoArgs)
✓ Updated Short and Long descriptions
✓ new.go deleted (328 lines)
✓ continue.go deleted (166 lines)
✓ No references to deleted files remain
✓ set and delete subcommands preserved
✓ Comprehensive test coverage (5 tests)
✓ All tests passing
✓ CLI builds successfully
✓ No dead code or unused imports
✓ Help text updated with wizard documentation

**Key Strengths:**
- TDD approach: Tests written first (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Proper test coverage: 5 tests verify command structure
- Clean migration: Old files deleted, no orphaned code
- Functionality preserved: set/delete commands still work
- Well-documented: Clear help text and examples
- Net reduction: -336 lines of code with improved design

**Command Behavior Verified:**
- `sow project` - Launches wizard ✓
- `sow project --help` - Shows wizard documentation ✓
- `sow project new` - Returns "unknown command" ✓
- `sow project continue` - Returns "unknown command" ✓
- `sow project wizard` - Returns "unknown command" ✓
- `sow project set --help` - Works correctly ✓
- `sow project delete --help` - Works correctly ✓

**Architecture Improvement:**
The project.go file is now much cleaner:
- Before: 38 lines with 3 subcommands (new, continue, wizard)
- After: 31 lines with 2 subcommands (set, delete)
- Main command now directly launches wizard
- Clearer user experience: `sow project` just works

The wizard foundation is now fully integrated and ready for users!

## Next Steps

Task complete. All 5 tasks (010-050) are now finished. Ready to advance to Review phase.

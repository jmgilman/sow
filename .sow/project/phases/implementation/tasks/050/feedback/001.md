## Summary
Reviewed final verification and cleanup:
- libs/schemas module: build, tests, lint all pass
- cli module: build, tests, lint all pass
- cli/schemas directory deleted
- No remaining old import references
- Code generation is idempotent

## Assessment

2. cli/ passes all tests (25 packages tested)
3. golangci-lint run passes with no issues
4. Old cli/schemas/ directory deleted
5. No remaining imports of github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/schemas

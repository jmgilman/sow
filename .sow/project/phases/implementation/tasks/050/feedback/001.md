# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed cleanup and final verification:
- Removed `cli/internal/exec/` directory (executor.go, mock.go)
- Verified no lingering references to old location
- Verified builds and tests pass for both modules
- Verified all original issue #115 acceptance criteria met

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:

1. **Cleanup:**
   - `cli/internal/exec/` directory removed completely
   - No references to `cli/internal/exec` remain in codebase (grep verified)

2. **libs/exec module verification:**
   - `go build ./...` passes
   - `go test -v ./...` passes (26 test cases)
   - `go test -race ./...` passes
   - `golangci-lint run ./...` passes

3. **CLI module verification:**
   - `go build ./...` passes
   - `go test ./...` passes (24 packages)
   - `golangci-lint run ./...` passes

4. **Final structure:**
   ```
   libs/exec/
   ├── go.mod
   ├── go.sum
   ├── README.md
   ├── doc.go
   ├── executor.go
   ├── local.go
   ├── local_test.go
   └── mocks/
       ├── executor.go
       └── executor_test.go
   ```

5. **Issue #115 acceptance criteria (all met):**
   - [x] New `libs/exec` Go module exists and compiles
   - [x] Clean `Executor` interface designed
   - [x] `LocalExecutor` implementation works correctly
   - [x] Mock generated via `moq` in `mocks/` subpackage
   - [x] All tests pass with proper behavioral coverage
   - [x] `golangci-lint run` passes with no issues
   - [x] README.md follows READMES.md standard
   - [x] Package documentation in doc.go
   - [x] All 8 consumer files updated to new import paths
   - [x] Old `cli/internal/exec/` removed

## Next Steps
Task complete. All implementation tasks finished. Ready to advance to review phase.

# Task 020 Review - Iteration 2: Intra-Phase State Progression Command

## Summary

Iteration 2 successfully addressed all feedback from iteration 1. All test compilation errors have been fixed and the full test suite now passes.

## Changes in Iteration 2

### Test Files Fixed (4 files)

✓ **cli/internal/project/standard/phases_test.go**
- Fixed 5 instances of `Approved: true/false` → `Approved: &approvedTrue/&approvedFalse`
- Created helper variables for bool pointers
- All tests now compile and pass

✓ **cli/internal/project/standard/prompts_test.go**
- Fixed 10+ instances of bool → *bool conversions
- Consistent pattern with helper variables
- All tests passing

✓ **cli/internal/project/collections_test.go**
- Fixed artifact approved field references
- Proper nil checks added where needed

✓ **cli/internal/project/statechart/guards_test.go**
- Fixed guard test fixtures
- Approved field properly handled as pointer

### Pattern Applied

Clean and consistent pattern throughout:
```go
// Create helper variable
approvedTrue := true
approvedFalse := false

// Use in structs
Approved: &approvedTrue
Approved: &approvedFalse

// Nil checks in conditionals
if artifact.Approved != nil && *artifact.Approved
```

This is the same pattern used successfully in Task 010 and ensures backward compatibility with the optional field.

## Verification

### Test Results

✓ **All tests passing**:
```
ok  	github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli
ok  	github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/internal/project
ok  	github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/internal/project/standard
ok  	github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/internal/project/statechart
ok  	github.com/jmgilman/sow/cli/schemas
... (12 packages total)
```

✓ **Advance tests specifically verified**:
- `TestAdvance_AllPhasesReturnErrNotSupported` - PASS
- `TestPlanningPhase_Advance` - PASS
- `TestImplementationPhase_Advance` - PASS
- `TestReviewPhase_Advance` - PASS
- `TestFinalizePhase_Advance` - PASS

✓ **Full codebase builds**: `go build ./...` completes successfully

## Complete Implementation Review

### Core Implementation (Iteration 1)

✓ **Phase Interface** (`cli/internal/project/domain/interfaces.go`):
- `Advance() (*PhaseOperationResult, error)` method added
- Proper documentation

✓ **CLI Command** (`cli/cmd/agent/advance.go`):
- Loads project and current phase
- Calls `phase.Advance()`
- Handles `ErrNotSupported` with clear error message
- Fires events from `PhaseOperationResult`
- Saves state after successful advance
- Excellent error handling and user messages

✓ **Command Registration** (`cli/cmd/agent/agent.go`):
- Command registered in agent command list
- Help text updated

✓ **All Standard Phases Implement Advance()**:
- `planning.go` - Returns `(nil, project.ErrNotSupported)`
- `implementation.go` - Returns `(nil, project.ErrNotSupported)`
- `review.go` - Returns `(nil, project.ErrNotSupported)`
- `finalize.go` - Returns `(nil, project.ErrNotSupported)`

### Testing (Both Iterations)

✓ **Test Coverage**:
- Phase-level tests for all 4 standard phases
- Command-level tests for advance functionality
- All existing tests still passing
- No regressions introduced

## All Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ `Phase.Advance()` method added to interface with signature `(*PhaseOperationResult, error)`
- ✅ `sow agent advance` command exists and is registered
- ✅ Command loads current project and calls `phase.Advance()`
- ✅ Command handles `ErrNotSupported` with clear message
- ✅ Command fires events from `PhaseOperationResult` when returned
- ✅ Command saves state after successful advance
- ✅ All existing standard project phases implement `Advance()` returning `(nil, project.ErrNotSupported)`
- ✅ Tests verify `ErrNotSupported` handling
- ✅ Tests verify event firing on successful advance
- ✅ Tests verify state persistence after advance
- ✅ **All tests compile and pass** (addressed in iteration 2)
- ✅ **Full codebase builds successfully** (addressed in iteration 2)

## Assessment

**APPROVED** ✓

Excellent work across both iterations:

**Iteration 1 Strengths**:
- Perfect implementation of core functionality
- Excellent code quality and structure
- Good error handling
- Clear documentation

**Iteration 2 Strengths**:
- Promptly addressed all feedback
- Consistent pattern applied across all test files
- Complete fix for breaking changes from Task 010
- All tests now passing

**Overall Quality**:
- Infrastructure is production-ready
- Provides foundation for future project types to implement real state transitions
- Standard phases correctly indicate lack of support
- Clean, maintainable code

## Recommendation

**Approve** and proceed to Task 030 (Project Type Detection and Routing System).

Task 020 is complete and provides the command infrastructure that future project types will use for intra-phase state progression.

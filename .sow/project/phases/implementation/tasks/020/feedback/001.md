# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the status output formatting improvements:

- **status.go** changes:
  - Added `countTasksByStatus()` helper function
  - Added `formatPhaseLine()` with consistent alignment (15 chars phase, 11 chars status)
  - Added `formatTaskLine()` with consistent alignment (12 chars status for "needs_review")
  - Refactored existing code to use these helpers

- **status_test.go** additions (5 new tests):
  - TestCountTasksByStatus (4 subtests: empty, all_pending, all_completed, mixed)
  - TestFormatTaskLine_StatusAlignment
  - TestRunStatus_PhaseOrderCorrect
  - TestRunStatus_TaskCountAccurate

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Implementation meets all acceptance criteria:
- Output is properly aligned and readable
- Phase names ordered correctly (implementation, review, finalize)
- Task counts are accurate
- Edge cases handled (empty tasks, mixed statuses)
- Helper functions properly extracted and documented

All 14 tests pass (9 original + 5 new).

Functional test shows clean, aligned output:
```
Phases:
  implementation   [in_progress]  2/4 tasks completed
  review           [pending    ]  0/0 tasks completed
  finalize         [pending    ]  0/0 tasks completed
```

Code quality is good - clean refactoring, well-documented helper functions.

## Next Steps

Task complete, moving on.

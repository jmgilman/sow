# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed Task 020: Rename Implementation to GitHubCLI

### Changes Made:
- Renamed `github.go` → `github_cli.go` (with git history preserved)
- Renamed `github_test.go` → `github_cli_test.go` (with git history preserved)
- Renamed struct: `GitHub` → `GitHubCLI`
- Renamed constructor: `NewGitHub()` → `NewGitHubCLI()`
- Added deprecated `NewGitHub()` wrapper for backward compatibility
- Updated all 9 method receivers from `*GitHub` to `*GitHubCLI`
- Added `CheckAvailability()` method delegating to `Ensure()`
- Updated all test references to use `NewGitHubCLI()`
- Updated `context.go` to use `*GitHubCLI` type

### Verification Steps Completed:
- ✓ Package compiles successfully: `go build ./internal/sow`
- ✓ All tests pass: `go test ./internal/sow` (21 tests, 0.291s)
- ✓ Git properly detects renames (preserves history)
- ✓ Backward compatibility maintained via deprecated wrapper
- ✓ Zero test logic changes

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent refactoring work! This task was executed with precision and care:

### Strengths:
1. **Proper Git Handling**: Used `git mv` to preserve file history during renames - excellent practice
2. **Comprehensive Updates**: All method receivers, constructor calls, and type references updated consistently
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Deprecated `NewGitHub()` wrapper ensures existing code continues working
4. **Smart Decision**: Correctly identified that the interface compliance check (`var _ GitHubClient = (*GitHubCLI)(nil)`) cannot be added yet because GitHubCLI doesn't fully implement the interface - the missing methods will be added in Task 030
5. **Clean Test Updates**: Only name changes in tests, no logic modifications needed
6. **Documentation**: Updated struct godoc to clarify this is the CLI implementation

### Acceptance Criteria - All Met (with one justified exception):
- [x] File renamed: `github.go` → `github_cli.go`
- [x] File renamed: `github_test.go` → `github_cli_test.go`
- [x] Struct renamed: `GitHub` → `GitHubCLI`
- [x] Constructor renamed: `NewGitHub()` → `NewGitHubCLI()`
- [x] Deprecated wrapper exists
- [x] All method receivers updated
- [x] CheckAvailability() implemented
- [~] Interface compliance check - **Deferred to Task 030** (would fail compilation now)
- [x] Struct godoc updated
- [x] Test references updated
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Package compiles

The decision to defer the interface compliance check is correct and well-documented.

## Next Steps

Task 020 is complete. Next dependencies:
- Task 030: Implement missing interface methods (UpdatePullRequest, MarkPullRequestReady, enhanced CreatePullRequest)
- Task 040: Create factory function (depends on 020)
- Task 060: Update wizard interface usage (depends on 020)

Ready to proceed to Task 030.

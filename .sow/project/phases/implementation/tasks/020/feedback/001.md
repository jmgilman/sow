# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of config init command:
- Created `cli/cmd/config/template.go` with configTemplate constant
- Created `cli/cmd/config/init.go` with newInitCmd() and supporting functions
- Created `cli/cmd/config/init_test.go` with 10 test cases
- Modified `cli/cmd/config/config.go` to register init subcommand
- Updated `cli/cmd/config/config_test.go` to expect init subcommand

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
Implementation correctly follows requirements:
- Template extracted to shared template.go file (DRY for edit command later)
- Uses testable helper functions (initConfigAtPath) for unit testing
- Checks for existing file and returns error with helpful message
- Creates parent directories with 0755 permissions
- Creates file with 0644 permissions
- Template is valid YAML and passes validation
- Template includes all documented agent roles and executor settings
- All 10 init tests + 6 config tests pass

## Next Steps
Task complete, moving to next task (030 - Config path command).

# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the implementation of the project type selection handler. The implementer successfully:

- Added comprehensive tests to `wizard_state_test.go` for `handleTypeSelect()`
- Replaced the stub implementation in `wizard_state.go` with a fully functional handler
- Updated existing tests in `wizard_test.go` to reflect non-stub status
- Followed TDD approach (tests before implementation)
- All tests passing (PASS: 2 test functions with 6 test cases total)

**Files Modified:**
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state.go` - Full handler implementation (lines 170-200)
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state_test.go` - Added tests for handleTypeSelect
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_test.go` - Updated existing tests

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation! All acceptance criteria met:

✅ **All Types Displayed** - All four project types shown with correct descriptions from `projectTypes` map
✅ **Selection Stored Correctly** - User selection properly stored in `w.choices["type"]`
✅ **State Transitions Work** - All transitions correct:
  - Any project type (standard/exploration/design/breakdown) → `StateNameEntry`
  - "cancel" → `StateCancelled`
  - Ctrl+C/Esc abort → `StateCancelled`
✅ **Uses Configuration Helper** - Properly uses `getTypeOptions()` for consistency with project type config
✅ **Code Quality** - Clean implementation following existing patterns
✅ **TDD Approach** - Tests created before implementation
✅ **Test Coverage** - All 4 project types + cancel + error handling tested

The implementation correctly:
- Uses `getTypeOptions()` helper to ensure descriptions match the `projectTypes` map
- Handles both explicit cancel selection and user abort (Ctrl+C)
- Stores type as string key for downstream handlers to use with `getTypePrefix()`
- Integrates cleanly with the wizard state machine

Test results show comprehensive coverage with 5 state transition test cases and proper error handling verification.

## Next Steps

Task complete. Marking as completed and moving to task 030.

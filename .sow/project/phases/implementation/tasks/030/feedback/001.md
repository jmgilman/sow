# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of the resume command:
- `cli/cmd/agent/resume.go` - Main resume command implementation with:
  - newResumeCmd() with proper Use, Short, Long, Args, --phase flag
  - runResume() implementing resume workflow
  - Reuses newExecutor variable and resolveTaskPhase() from spawn.go
- `cli/cmd/agent/resume_test.go` - 13 comprehensive tests
- `cli/cmd/agent/agent.go` - Updated with resume subcommand registration

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:
1. Command takes task-id and prompt as arguments (cobra.ExactArgs(2))
2. --phase flag for optional phase override
3. Verifies session ID exists with helpful error message: "no session found for task %s (spawn first with 'sow agent spawn')"
4. Checks SupportsResumption() before calling Resume()
5. Error message for no resumption: "executor does not support session resumption"
6. Does NOT modify session ID (verified by test)
7. Uses shared newExecutor for dependency injection
8. All tests pass (40 total in agent package)
9. Clear documentation with usage examples in Long description

Code quality is excellent - follows patterns from spawn.go, comprehensive error handling.

## Next Steps
All 3 tasks complete. Ready to advance to Review phase.

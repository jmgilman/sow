# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed mock generation implementation:
- `libs/exec/executor.go` - Added `//go:generate` directive for moq
- `libs/exec/doc.go` - Removed obsolete mockgen directive, updated examples
- `libs/exec/mocks/executor.go` - Generated mock via moq
- `libs/exec/mocks/executor_test.go` - Smoke tests for mock

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:

1. `libs/exec/mocks/` directory exists
2. `//go:generate go run github.com/matryer/moq@latest -out mocks/executor.go -pkg mocks . Executor` added to executor.go
3. Generated mock:
   - Package `mocks` (not `exec`)
   - Implements `exec.Executor` (compile-time check present)
   - Provides function fields for all 6 methods
   - Includes call tracking via `*Calls()` methods
4. Removed incorrect mockgen directive from doc.go
5. Updated doc.go examples to show moq-style mock usage
6. Added smoke tests verifying:
   - Interface implementation
   - Basic usage for all methods
   - Panic behavior when methods not configured

**Verification:**
- `go generate ./...` completed successfully
- `go build ./...` passes
- `go test ./...` passes (11 new tests in mocks package)
- `golangci-lint run ./...` passes (per log.md)

## Next Steps
Task complete. Proceeding to task 040 (consumer migration).

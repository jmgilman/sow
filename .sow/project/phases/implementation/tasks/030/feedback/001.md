# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of config path command:
- Created `cli/cmd/config/path.go` with newPathCmd() and runPath()
- Created `cli/cmd/config/path_test.go` with 10 test cases
- Modified `cli/cmd/config/config.go` to register path subcommand
- Added test for path subcommand in config_test.go

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
Implementation correctly follows requirements:
- Shows correct platform-appropriate path
- `--exists` flag outputs clean "true" or "false"
- Never returns error for existence check
- Output is clean for scripting (no extra formatting)
- Uses testable helper function (runPathWithOptions)
- All 10 path tests pass plus init and config tests

## Next Steps
Task complete, moving to next task (040 - Config show command).

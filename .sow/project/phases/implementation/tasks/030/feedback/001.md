# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed import path migration across 75 consumer files:
- cli/go.mod updated with libs/schemas dependency and replace directive
- All 75 Go files updated to use new import paths
- `cli/schemas` → `libs/schemas`
- `cli/schemas/project` → `libs/schemas/project`
- Build and tests pass
- No remaining old import paths

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria have been met:
1. cli/go.mod includes replace directive for libs/schemas
2. All 75 consumer files have updated import paths
3. No remaining references to `cli/schemas` in import statements (only in comments)
4. go build ./... succeeds
5. go test ./... succeeds (all packages pass)
6. golangci-lint run passes

The comments referencing old paths (in doc.go and validate.go) are documentation references and do not affect compilation. These can be updated in the cleanup phase.

## Next Steps
Task complete, proceeding to task 040 (add documentation).

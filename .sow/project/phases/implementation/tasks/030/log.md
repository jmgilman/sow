Worker actions will be logged here.

## 2025-10-31 - Implementation Complete

### Overview
Implemented project type detection and routing system per design specification in core-design.md.

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Created DetectProjectType Function
- File: `cli/internal/project/types.go`
- Implements branch prefix detection:
  - `explore/` → "exploration"
  - `design/` → "design"
  - `breakdown/` → "breakdown"
  - All others → "standard" (default)
- Follows TDD approach with comprehensive tests

#### 2. Updated Loader.Load() Method
- File: `cli/internal/project/loader/loader.go`
- Added type routing based on `state.Project.Type` discriminator
- Returns helpful error messages for unimplemented types (exploration, design, breakdown)
- Returns error for unknown project types
- Standard projects continue to work unchanged

#### 3. Updated Loader.Create() Method
- File: `cli/internal/project/loader/loader.go`
- Added type detection from branch name using `DetectProjectType()`
- Returns clear error for unimplemented types with branch information
- Only allows standard projects to be created (backward compatible)

#### 4. Created Comprehensive Tests
- File: `cli/internal/project/types_test.go`
  - 13 test cases covering all branch prefix scenarios
  - Tests default behavior for unknown prefixes
  - Tests edge cases (empty string, prefix in middle of name)

- File: `cli/internal/project/loader/loader_test.go`
  - Tests standard project loading (existing functionality preserved)
  - Tests error messages for unimplemented types (exploration, design, breakdown)
  - Tests unknown type handling
  - Tests type detection from branch names in Create()
  - Tests validation and directory creation (existing functionality preserved)
  - Total: 10 test functions with multiple sub-tests

### Test Results
All tests passing:
- `TestDetectProjectType`: 13/13 passed
- All loader tests: 10/10 passed
- All existing project package tests: passed

### Files Modified
1. `cli/internal/project/types.go` (created)
2. `cli/internal/project/types_test.go` (created)
3. `cli/internal/project/loader/loader.go` (modified)
4. `cli/internal/project/loader/loader_test.go` (created)

### Implementation Notes
- Infrastructure-only implementation as specified
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- Standard projects continue to work unchanged
- Unknown branch prefixes default to "standard" (backward compatible)
- Ready for future implementation of exploration, design, and breakdown project types
- All acceptance criteria met

### Next Steps
This task is complete and ready for review. The routing infrastructure is in place for tasks 040 (exploration), 050 (design), and 060 (breakdown) to implement their respective project types.

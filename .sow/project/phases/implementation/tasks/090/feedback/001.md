# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed the migration of all CLI consumers to use libs/project module:
- 132 files modified across cli/cmd/, cli/internal/
- Updated imports from cli/internal/sdks/... to libs/project/...
- Deleted old cli/internal/sdks/state/ and cli/internal/sdks/project/ packages

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

All acceptance criteria met:

1. All CLI commands updated to use libs/project types
2. All internal packages updated to use libs/project types
3. Project type definitions (breakdown, design, exploration, standard) updated
4. Old SDK packages deleted (cli/internal/sdks/state/, cli/internal/sdks/project/)
5. cli/go.mod updated with libs/project dependency
6. `go build ./...` compiles successfully
7. `go test -race ./...` all tests pass (breakdown, design, exploration, standard)
8. `golangci-lint run ./...` passes with 0 issues

Key verification:
- All 132 modified files compile
- Integration tests for all project types pass
- No remaining references to old SDK packages

## Next Steps

Task complete, proceeding to task 100 (README and cleanup).

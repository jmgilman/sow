# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of config edit command:
- Created `cli/cmd/config/edit.go` with newEditCmd(), runEdit(), getEditor()
- Created `cli/cmd/config/edit_test.go` with 14 test cases
- Modified `cli/cmd/config/config.go` to register edit subcommand
- Added test for edit subcommand in config_test.go

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
Implementation correctly follows requirements:
- Opens config file in $EDITOR
- Falls back to "vi" if $EDITOR not set
- Creates file with template if missing
- Creates parent directories with 0755 permissions
- Creates file with 0644 permissions
- Passes stdin/stdout/stderr to editor for interactive use
- Reports editor errors appropriately
- Reuses shared configTemplate from template.go
- All 14 edit tests pass

## Next Steps
Task complete, moving to final task (070 - Config reset command).

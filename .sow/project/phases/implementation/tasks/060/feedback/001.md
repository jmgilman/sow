# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed the cleanup of old config code from CLI:

Files deleted:
- `cli/internal/sow/config.go` - Repo config loading (now in libs/config/repo.go)
- `cli/internal/sow/user_config.go` - User config loading (now in libs/config/user.go)
- `cli/internal/sow/user_config_test.go` - Tests for removed code

Files modified:
- `cli/cmd/config/init_test.go` - Updated import from internal/sow to libs/config

Files remaining in cli/internal/sow/ (as expected):
- context.go, context_test.go
- errors.go
- fs.go
- git.go, github_*.go, worktree.go
- options.go, sow.go

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
All acceptance criteria met:
- config.go deleted
- user_config.go deleted
- user_config_test.go deleted (test for removed code)
- No dangling references to removed symbols
- cli/internal/sow/ package still compiles
- All CLI tests pass (23 packages)
- go build ./... succeeds
- golangci-lint passes with 0 issues

Good implementation:
- Found and fixed remaining reference in init_test.go
- Used git rm for proper version control tracking
- Also removed the test file for deleted code

## Next Steps
All 6 implementation tasks complete. Ready to advance to review phase.

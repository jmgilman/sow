# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Task 060 successfully adds human-readable descriptions to all 10 transitions in the standard project type with comprehensive test coverage.

**Files Modified:**
- `cli/internal/projects/standard/standard.go`: Added `WithDescription()` to all 10 transitions
- `cli/internal/projects/standard/lifecycle_test.go`: Added 2 comprehensive test functions

**Key Changes:**
1. Added descriptions to all 10 state transitions:
   - NoProject → ImplementationPlanning: "Initialize project and begin implementation planning"
   - ImplementationPlanning → DraftPRCreation: "Task descriptions approved, create draft PR"
   - DraftPRCreation → ImplementationExecuting: "Draft PR created, begin task execution"
   - ImplementationExecuting → ReviewActive: "All implementation tasks completed, ready for review"
   - ReviewActive → FinalizeChecks: "Review approved, proceed to finalization checks"
   - ReviewActive → ImplementationPlanning: "Review failed, return to implementation planning for rework"
   - FinalizeChecks → FinalizePRReady: "Checks completed, prepare PR for final review"
   - FinalizePRReady → FinalizePRChecks: "PR body approved, monitoring PR checks"
   - FinalizePRChecks → FinalizeCleanup: "All PR checks passed, begin cleanup"
   - FinalizeCleanup → NoProject: "Cleanup complete, project finalized"

2. Added `TestStandardProjectDescriptions()` with 10 sub-tests:
   - Verifies each transition has non-empty description
   - Checks descriptions are under 100 characters (concise)
   - Validates descriptions are meaningful (not just event name)
   - Ensures no placeholder text (TODO, etc.)

3. Added `TestDescriptionQuality()`:
   - Verifies all 10 descriptions are unique (no copy-paste errors)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 10 transition description tests pass
- ✅ Description quality test passes
- ✅ All existing lifecycle tests pass (no regressions)

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent implementation with comprehensive quality assurance:

✅ **Complete Coverage**: All 10 transitions now have descriptions
✅ **Quality Descriptions**: Each description is:
  - Concise (under 100 characters)
  - Meaningful (explains purpose/outcome, not just mechanics)
  - Unique (no duplicates)
  - Professional (no placeholder text)
  - Consistent in style and voice
✅ **Test Coverage**: Both individual and aggregate quality tests
✅ **No Behavior Changes**: Only metadata added - all existing tests pass
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing projects continue to work
✅ **User Experience**: Descriptions will show in `--list` mode, improving discoverability

**Description highlights:**
- Clear intent: "Initialize", "begin", "proceed", "monitoring"
- Outcome-focused: Describes what happens, not how it happens
- Helpful for orchestrators using `--list` to understand options

All acceptance criteria met:
- All 10 transitions have descriptions ✓
- Descriptions are clear and helpful ✓
- No typos or grammatical errors ✓
- Consistent style across all descriptions ✓
- Tests pass ✓
- Manual testing possible with `--list` ✓

## Next Steps

Task complete. Moving to task 070 (Refactor ReviewActive with AddBranch API) - the core refactoring work.

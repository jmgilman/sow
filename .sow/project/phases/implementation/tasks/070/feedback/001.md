# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed final cleanup and verification:

**Verification results:**
- Old files deleted: All 10 git/github files removed (done in task 060)
- Remaining files valid: context.go, context_test.go, errors.go, fs.go, options.go, sow.go
- libs/git independent: No cli/internal dependencies
- No old import paths: No grep matches for old imports
- Build passes: Both cli and libs/git compile
- Tests pass: All packages in both modules
- Linting clean: 0 issues in both modules

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

All acceptance criteria verified:

1. ✅ Old files deleted: All git/github files removed from cli/internal/sow
2. ✅ Remaining files valid: context.go, fs.go, sow.go, errors.go compile
3. ✅ No orphan imports: No import errors in remaining files
4. ✅ Full build passes: `go build ./...` succeeds in both modules
5. ✅ All tests pass: All packages pass in cli and libs/git
6. ✅ Linting passes: 0 issues
7. ✅ libs/git independent: No cli/internal dependencies found
8. ✅ No old import paths: Grep verified clean
9. ✅ Module compiles standalone: libs/git builds independently
10. ✅ Consumer tests work: cli tests using git functionality pass

The migration from cli/internal/sow to libs/git is complete.

## Next Steps

Task complete. All implementation tasks done. Ready to advance to review phase.

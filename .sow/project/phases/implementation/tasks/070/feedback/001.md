# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary

Reviewed Task 070: Skip Type Selection for GitHub Issues

**Files Modified:**
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state.go` - Modified showIssueSelectScreen() to skip type selection
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_state_test.go` - Updated and added comprehensive tests
- `cli/cmd/project/wizard_integration_test.go` - Updated integration test for new flow

**Key Changes:**
- Set `w.choices["type"] = "standard"` automatically for GitHub issues
- Call `w.createLinkedBranch()` directly instead of transitioning to StateTypeSelect
- Added comprehensive test `TestGitHubIssuePath_SkipsTypeSelection`
- Updated existing tests to reflect new behavior

**Test Results:**
- All tests pass (full suite: 4.820s)
- New test validates end-to-end flow
- No regressions in branch name path

## Assessment

**PASS**

## Feedback

Excellent UX improvement! The type selection screen has been successfully bypassed for GitHub issues.

✓ **Problem Solved**: GitHub issues now skip type selection entirely, reducing screens by 33%
✓ **Clean Implementation**: Minimal code change (5 lines) with maximum UX impact
✓ **Correct Default**: Type automatically set to "standard" for all GitHub issues
✓ **Direct Flow**: Transitions directly from issue selection to branch creation to prompt entry
✓ **Branch Prefix Verified**: Uses "feat/" prefix (standard type) as expected
✓ **Comprehensive Testing**: New end-to-end test `TestGitHubIssuePath_SkipsTypeSelection` validates full flow
✓ **No Regressions**: Branch name path still shows type selection correctly
✓ **All Tests Pass**: Full test suite passing with new and updated tests

**Flow Improvement:**
- **Before**: Issue Selection → Type Selection → Prompt Entry (3 screens)
- **After**: Issue Selection → Prompt Entry (2 screens) - **33% reduction**

**Code Quality:**
- TDD approach: tests updated first, then implementation
- Clear and focused change
- Backward compatible with branch name path
- Well-documented in tests

**User Experience:**
- Streamlined workflow for most common use case
- Eliminates unnecessary decision point
- Reduces cognitive load
- Faster project creation from GitHub issues

Both UX fixes (Tasks 060 and 070) complete the rework iteration successfully. The GitHub issue integration workflow is now production-ready with improved user experience.

## Next Steps

Task complete. Proceeding to commit and push changes. All rework tasks complete - ready to advance to Review phase.

# Review - Iteration 1

## Summary
Reviewed implementation of config reset command:
- Created `cli/cmd/config/reset.go` with newResetCmd(), runReset(), resetConfigAtPath()
- Created `cli/cmd/config/reset_test.go` with 14 test cases
- Modified `cli/cmd/config/config.go` to register reset subcommand
- Added test for reset subcommand in config_test.go

## Assessment
**PASS**

## Feedback
Implementation correctly follows requirements:
- Removes config file after confirmation
- Creates backup at config.yaml.backup before removal
- Prompts for confirmation unless --force/-f
- Accepts "y" and "yes" (case insensitive)
- Cancels on other input (including empty/Enter)
- Handles missing file gracefully
- Reports success with backup location
- Uses testable helper with path parameter
- All 14 reset tests pass

This completes all 7 tasks for the config CLI commands feature.

## Next Steps
All implementation tasks complete. Ready to advance to review phase.

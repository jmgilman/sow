- Build successful

## Assessment

**PASS** (pending manual verification)

## Feedback

Excellent minimal fix following the documented approach:

**Strengths:**
- **Minimal change**: Single line addition, exactly as suggested in Option 1 from task description
- **Well-documented**: Added clear comment explaining why the Group title is needed for filterable MultiSelect
- **Follows library requirements**: huh library needs Group title for filterable MultiSelect to display properly
- **No side effects**: All existing tests pass, no regressions
- **Targeted solution**: Addresses root cause without changing behavior

**Code Quality:**
- Clean implementation
- Good inline comment
- Follows existing code style
- No breaking changes

**Test Coverage:**
- All automated tests pass ✓
- File selection tests pass ✓
- No regressions ✓

## Manual Verification Required

**IMPORTANT**: This fix requires manual testing to confirm the title now displays in the interactive UI.

**To verify:**
1. Run the wizard: `sow project wizard`
2. Create a project and proceed to file selection screen
3. Confirm both titles display:
   - Group title: "File Selection"
   - MultiSelect title: "Select knowledge files to provide context (optional):"
4. Verify description still shows: "Type to filter • Space to select • Enter to confirm"
5. Test filtering, selection, and all interactions work

## Next Steps

Task complete from code perspective. Ready for human manual testing verification before finalizing.

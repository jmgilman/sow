**Action**: analyzed_requirements
**Result**: success
**Files**:
- docs/DISTRIBUTION.md
- docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md
- ROADMAP.md
- .sow/knowledge/adrs/001-go-cli-architecture.md

**Notes**: Reviewed all referenced documentation to understand CLI architecture, distribution requirements, and Milestone 1 success criteria. The CLI uses Go with embedded CUE schemas, requires cross-platform distribution, and must align versions with the plugin. Key requirements include build automation, GitHub Releases integration, and installation methods.

**Action**: started_design
**Result**: success
**Files**: .sow/knowledge/adrs/002-build-and-distribution-strategy.md

**Notes**: Creating comprehensive ADR for build and distribution strategy. Will cover: (1) Build tooling and cross-compilation, (2) Release automation and GitHub integration, (3) Installation methods and package managers, (4) Version alignment strategy. Focusing on pragmatic solutions that support the Go CLI architecture defined in ADR 001.

**Action**: created_document
**Result**: success
**Files**: .sow/knowledge/adrs/002-build-and-distribution-strategy.md

**Notes**: Completed comprehensive ADR for build and distribution strategy. Key decisions: (1) Use GoReleaser for automated builds and releases - eliminates manual work and provides cross-platform builds, checksums, GitHub releases, and Homebrew tap generation automatically. (2) GitHub Releases as primary distribution channel with Homebrew as secondary. (3) Install script for direct downloads. (4) Version alignment strategy ensuring CLI version = plugin version = schema version. (5) Semantic versioning with clear upgrade paths. Document includes detailed GoReleaser config, GitHub Actions workflow, installation methods for all platforms, and release checklist. All examples are concrete and ready for implementation.

**Action**: completed_task
**Result**: success
**Files**: .sow/knowledge/adrs/002-build-and-distribution-strategy.md

**Notes**: Task complete. Delivered comprehensive design document covering all requirements: build strategy (GoReleaser + cross-compilation), release process (GitHub Actions automation), installation methods (Homebrew, direct download, install script), and version alignment (single version across all components). The strategy prioritizes automation, consistency, and user experience. Ready for implementation in Milestone 1.

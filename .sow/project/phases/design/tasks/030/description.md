# Task: Define build and distribution strategy

## Objective

Define the build process and distribution strategy for creating cross-platform CLI binaries (macOS, Linux, Windows).

## Context

The CLI needs to be distributed as standalone binaries for multiple platforms. Need to define build tooling, release process, and installation methods.

## Requirements

1. **Define build strategy**:
   - Cross-compilation approach for macOS, Linux, Windows
   - Binary naming conventions
   - Version embedding in binary
   - Build automation (Makefile, goreleaser, or custom scripts)

2. **Define release process**:
   - Version tagging strategy
   - GitHub Releases integration
   - Checksums and signatures
   - Release automation

3. **Define installation methods**:
   - Direct binary download
   - Package managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.) - if applicable
   - Installation verification
   - PATH setup instructions

4. **Define version alignment**:
   - How CLI version matches schema version
   - Version checking mechanism
   - Upgrade path strategy

5. **Create design document**:
   - Document build and distribution strategy
   - Place in `.sow/knowledge/` or as ADR
   - Include examples and commands

**Action**: analyzed_requirements
**Result**: success
**Files**: [docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, schemas/cue/project-state.cue, schemas/cue/task-state.cue]
**Notes**: Analyzed complete CLI requirements including all commands (init, validate, schema, log, session-info, sinks, repos), CUE schema embedding strategy, and context detection needs.

**Action**: created_file
**Result**: success
**Files**: [.sow/knowledge/adrs/001-go-cli-architecture.md]
**Notes**: Created comprehensive ADR documenting Go CLI architecture. Covers: 1) Project structure (cmd/, internal/, pkg/), 2) Command routing with Cobra, 3) CUE schema embedding strategy using go:embed, 4) Context auto-detection logic, 5) Core abstractions (validation, filesystem, errors), 6) Fast logging implementation, 7) Build and distribution approach. Includes code examples, rationale, consequences, and alternatives considered.

**Action**: completed_task
**Result**: success
**Files**: [.sow/knowledge/adrs/001-go-cli-architecture.md]
**Notes**: Task completed successfully. Deliverables: ADR with complete CLI architecture design, project structure definition, command routing design, schema embedding strategy, core abstractions, and implementation phases. Architecture is ready for implementer to build CLI.
